Find the instance of a given class type that is closest to a given instance. This method uses the getParent method from the Tag interface. This method is used for coordination among cooperating tags. The current version of the specification only provides one formal way of indicating the observable type of a tag handler: its tag handler implementation class, described in the tag-class subelement of the tag element. This is extended in an informal manner by allowing the tag library author to indicate in the description subelement an observable type. The type should be a subtype of the tag handler implementation class or void. This additional constraint can be exploited by a specialized container that knows about that specific tag library, as in the case of the JSP standard tag library. When a tag library author provides information on the observable type of a tag handler, client programmatic code should adhere to that constraint. Specifically, the Class passed to findAncestorWithClass should be a subtype of the observable type.

The user deletes/renames the locks directory. 2. The user deletes/renames the server.lock file AND the server is running. 3. The server is not running but the user that is running the code does not have file system access rights. 4. The server is not running and another process has a lock on the file.

This method is called by the OpenAMSessionTokenServerInterceptor and OpenAMSessionTokenClientInterceptor classes when determining whether to assert the TransportToken. The AbstractTokenInterceptor#assertTokens is called in all four JASPI phases. The isTLSInUse implemented in the AbstractTokenInterceptor does not work in the secure-request or validate-response phases - it seems to work exclusively in the validate-request case. The OpenAMSessionToken interceptors need to assert the TransportToken in all four cases to prevent FINE warning messages concerning an unasserted TransportToken, hence this override, which works in all cases. This override will also consult the superclass method. Note however, that there is no state in the outgoing message corresponding to "http.scheme" in the server egress message, so the validate-response is not able to assert the TransportToken, and thus the FINE message warning of an unasserted TransportToken will appear. This is really the domain of the TransportBindingHandler (see http://cxf.547215.n5.nabble.com/Custom-SecurityPolicy-Assertions-and-the-Symmetric-binding-td5754879.html for details), so we will have to live with this error message.

Returns the DynAny for the component at the current position. It does not advance the current position, so repeated calls to current_component without an intervening call to rewind, next, or seek return the same component. The returned DynAny object reference can be used to get/set the value of the current component. If the current component represents a complex type, the returned reference can be narrowed based on the TypeCode to get the interface corresponding to the to the complex type. Calling current_component on a DynAny that cannot have components, such as a DynEnum or an empty exception, raises TypeMismatch. Calling current_component on a DynAny whose current position is -1 returns a nil reference. The iteration operations, together with current_component, can be used to dynamically compose an any value. After creating a dynamic any, such as a DynStruct, current_component and next can be used to initialize all the components of the value. Once the dynamic value is completely initialized, to_any creates the corresponding any value.

Destroys a DynAny object. This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object. It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy() to avoid resource leaks. Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects (for example, on objects returned by the current_component operation) does nothing. Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it. That is, references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid. Invocations on such references raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST. It is possible to manipulate a component of a DynAny beyond the life time of the DynAny from which the component was obtained by making a copy of the component with the copy operation before destroying the DynAny from which the component was obtained.

This method acts like a check that bytes that were parsed are really all image bytes. If it's true, then decoding will succeed, but if not all image bytes were read and "<ws>EI<ws>" bytes were just a part of the image, then decoding should fail. Not the best solution, but probably there is no better and more reliable way to check this. Drawbacks: slow; images with DCTDecode, JBIG2Decode and JPXDecode filters couldn't be checked as iText doesn't support these filters; what if decoding will succeed eventhough it's not all bytes?; also I'm not sure that all filters throw an exception in case data is corrupted (For example, FlateDecodeFilter seems not to throw an exception).

Services a Commandline Request.
Handles an initial authorization request from a OAuth2 client, validates the request is valid and contains the required parameters, checks the resource owner has authenticated and given their consent for the client to be authorized before issuing an AuthorizationToken. If the resource owner is not authenticated, then the user-agent is redirected to a login page for the resource owner to authenticate. And if the resource owner has not given their consent (or have not requested it to be saved from a previous authorization request) the user-agent is redirected to the user consent page. The user-agent is then redirected back to the OAuth2 authorize endpoint. An AuthorizationToken is only ever issued by this method if the resource owner has previously given their consent. In the case where the user-agent is redirected to the user consent page, when the user-agent is redirected back to OAuth2 authorize endpoint the #authorize(OAuth2Request, boolean, boolean) method on this class must be called.

Read data from the input buffer and put it into a byte chunk. The buffer is owned by the protocol implementation - it will be reused on the next read.

For token transformations with x509 certificates as an input token type, a client's identity can only be asserted via x509 certificates presented via two-way-tls. This certificate can be obtained via the attribute referenced by the javax.servlet.request.X509Certificate key (if the container is deployed with two-way-tls), or from the header referenced by offloadedTlsClientCertKey, in case OpenAM is deployed behind infrastructure which performs tls-offloading. This method will consult header value if configured for this rest-sts instance, and if not configured, the ClientInfoContxt will be consulted, which contains the state corresponding to the javax.servlet.request.X509Certificate attribute. An exception will be thrown if the client cert cannot be obtained.

Prints messages only when the debug state is either DEBUG.MESSAGE or Debug.ON. <p><b>NOTE:</b> Debugging is an IO intensive operation and may hurt application performance when abused. Particularly, note that Java evaluates arguments to <code>message()</code> even when debugging is turned off. So when the argument to this method involves the String concatenation operator '+' or any other method invocation, <code>messageEnabled</code> <b>MUST</b> be used. It is recommended that the debug state be checked by invoking <code>messageEnabled()</code> before invoking any <code>message()</code> methods to avoid unnecessary argument evaluation and maximize application performance.</p>
Allows us to navigate to a certain point.
computes the length of binary data speculatively. Our requirement is to create byte[] of the exact length to store the binary data. If we do this in a straight-forward way, it takes two passes over the data. Experiments show that this is a non-trivial overhead (35% or so is spent on the first pass in calculating the length.) So the approach here is that we compute the length speculatively, without looking at the whole contents. The obtained speculative value is never less than the actual length of the binary data, but it may be bigger. So if the speculation goes wrong, we'll pay the cost of reallocation and buffer copying. If the base64 text is tightly packed with no indentation nor illegal char (like what most web services produce), then the speculation of this method will be correct, so we get the performance benefit.

Calling current_component on a DynAny that cannot have components, such as a DynEnum or an empty exception, raises TypeMismatch. Calling current_component on a DynAny whose current position is -1 returns a nil reference. The iteration operations, together with current_component, can be used to dynamically compose an any value. After creating a dynamic any, such as a DynStruct, current_component and next can be used to initialize all the components of the value. Once the dynamic value is completely initialized, to_any creates the corresponding any value.

Perform the attributeLevel rights evaluation on a list of specified attribute types. Each attribute has an access check done for the following rights: search, read, compare, add, delete, proxy, selfwrite_add, selfwrite_delete and write. The special rights, selfwrite_add and selfwrite_delete, use the authZid as the attribute value to evaluate against the attribute type being evaluated. The selfwrite_add performs the access check using the ACI_WRITE_ADD right and selfwrite_delete uses ACI_WRITE_ADD right. The write right is made complicated by the targattrfilters keyword, which might depend on an unknown value of an attribute type. For this case a dummy attribute value is used to try and determine if a "?" needs to be placed in the rights string. The special flag ACI_SKIP_PROXY_CHECK is always set, so that proxy evaluation is bypassed in the Aci Handler's accessAllowed method.

Returns the DynAny for the component at the current position. It does not advance the current position, so repeated calls to current_component without an intervening call to rewind, next, or seek return the same component. The returned DynAny object reference can be used to get/set the value of the current component. If the current component represents a complex type, the returned reference can be narrowed based on the TypeCode to get the interface corresponding to the to the complex type. Calling current_component on a DynAny that cannot have components, such as a DynEnum or an empty exception, raises TypeMismatch. Calling current_component on a DynAny whose current position is -1 returns a nil reference. The iteration operations, together with current_component, can be used to dynamically compose an any value. After creating a dynamic any, such as a DynStruct, current_component and next can be used to initialize all the components of the value. Once the dynamic value is completely initialized, to_any creates the corresponding any value.

Destroys a DynAny object. This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object. It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy() to avoid resource leaks. Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects (for example, on objects returned by the current_component operation) does nothing. Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it. That is, references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid. Invocations on such references raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST. It is possible to manipulate a component of a DynAny beyond the life time of the DynAny from which the component was obtained by making a copy of the component with the copy operation before destroying the DynAny from which the component was obtained.

<p>Authenticate the user making this request, based on the fact that no <code>login-config</code> has been defined for the container.</p> <p>This implementation means "login the user even though there is no self-contained way to establish a security Principal for that user".</p> <p>This method is called by the AuthenticatorBase super class to establish a Principal for the user BEFORE the container security constraints are examined, i.e. it is not yet known whether the user will eventually be permitted to access the requested resource. Therefore, it is necessary to always return <code>true</code> to indicate the user has not failed authentication.</p> <p>There are two cases:</p> <li>without SingleSignon: a Session instance does not yet exist and there is no <code>auth-method</code> to authenticate the user, so leave Request's Principal as null. Note: AuthenticatorBase will later examine the security constraints to determine whether the resource is accessible by a user without a security Principal and Role (i.e. unauthenticated). <li>with SingleSignon: if the user has already authenticated via another container (using its own login configuration), then associate this Session with the SSOEntry so it inherits the already-established security Principal and associated Roles. Note: This particular session will become a full member of the SingleSignOnEntry Session collection and so will potentially keep the SSOE "alive", even if all the other properly authenticated Sessions expire first... until it expires too.

Destroys a DynAny object. This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object. It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy() to avoid resource leaks. Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects (for example, on objects returned by the current_component operation) does nothing. Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it. That is, references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid. Invocations on such references raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST. It is possible to manipulate a component of a DynAny beyond the life time of the DynAny from which the component was obtained by making a copy of the component with the copy operation before destroying the DynAny from which the component was obtained.

7.2.21 emptyPropertyElt start-element ( URI == propertyElementURIs, attributes == set ( idAttr?, ( resourceAttr | nodeIdAttr )?, propertyAttr* ) ) end-element() <!-- a simple property with an empty value --> <ns:Prop2 rdf:resource="http: *www.adobe.com/"/> <!-- a URI value --> <ns:Prop3 rdf:value="..." ns:Qual="..."/> <!-- a simple qualified property --> <ns:Prop4 ns:Field1="..." ns:Field2="..."/> <!-- a struct with simple fields --> An emptyPropertyElt is an element with no contained content, just a possibly empty set of attributes. An emptyPropertyElt can represent three special cases of simple XMP properties: a simple property with an empty value (ns:Prop1), a simple property whose value is a URI (ns:Prop2), or a simple property with simple qualifiers (ns:Prop3). An emptyPropertyElt can also represent an XMP struct whose fields are all simple and unqualified (ns:Prop4). It is an error to use both rdf:value and rdf:resource - that can lead to invalid RDF in the verbose form written using a literalPropertyElt. The XMP mapping for an emptyPropertyElt is a bit different from generic RDF, partly for design reasons and partly for historical reasons. The XMP mapping rules are: If there is an rdf:value attribute then this is a simple property with a text value. All other attributes are qualifiers. If there is an rdf:resource attribute then this is a simple property with a URI value. All other attributes are qualifiers. If there are no attributes other than xml:lang, rdf:ID, or rdf:nodeID then this is a simple property with an empty value. Otherwise this is a struct, the attributes other than xml:lang, rdf:ID, or rdf:nodeID are fields.

Merges two policy decisions. Merging policy decisions merges each action decision of the policy with the corresponding action decision of the other policy. This method also merges ResponseProviderDecision of one policy ( response attributes per policy) with that of the other policy. These are the rules followed to merge each action decision: If the action schema has boolean syntax, boolean false value overrides boolean true value. The time to live of boolean false value overrides the time to live of boolean true value. Otherwise, action values are simply aggregated. Time to live is set to the minimum of time to live(s) of all values of the action. For response attributes, all response attributes are aggregated. In case of mutiple values for the same attribute they appear as multi valued data for the attribute.

Writes a Java object tree to XML and store it to the specified location.
Used to create an event when nodes have been changed, inserted, or removed, identifying the path to the parent of the modified items as an array of Objects. All of the modified objects are siblings which are direct descendents (not grandchildren) of the specified parent. The positions at which the inserts, deletes, or changes occurred are specified by an array of <code>int</code>. The indexes in that array must be in order, from lowest to highest. For changes, the indexes in the model correspond exactly to the indexes of items currently displayed in the UI. As a result, it is not really critical if the indexes are not in their exact order. But after multiple inserts or deletes, the items currently in the UI no longer correspond to the items in the model. It is therefore critical to specify the indexes properly for inserts and deletes. For inserts, the indexes represent the <i>final</i> state of the tree, after the inserts have occurred. Since the indexes must be specified in order, the most natural processing methodology is to do the inserts starting at the lowest index and working towards the highest. Accumulate a Vector of <code>Integer</code> objects that specify the insert-locations as you go, then convert the Vector to an array of <code>int</code> to create the event. When the postition-index equals zero, the node is inserted at the beginning of the list. When the position index equals the size of the list, the node is "inserted" at (appended to) the end of the list. For deletes, the indexes represent the <i>initial</i> state of the tree, before the deletes have occurred. Since the indexes must be specified in order, the most natural processing methodology is to use a delete-counter. Start by initializing the counter to zero and start work through the list from lowest to higest. Every time you do a delete, add the current value of the delete-counter to the index-position where the delete occurred, and append the result to a Vector of delete-locations, using <code>addElement()</code>. Then increment the delete-counter. The index positions stored in the Vector therefore reflect the effects of all previous deletes, so they represent each object's position in the initial tree. (You could also start at the highest index and working back towards the lowest, accumulating a Vector of delete-locations as you go using the <code>insertElementAt(Integer, 0)</code>.) However you produce the Vector of initial-positions, you then need to convert the Vector of <code>Integer</code> objects to an array of <code>int</code> to create the event. <b>Notes:</b><ul> <li>Like the <code>insertNodeInto</code> method in the <code>DefaultTreeModel</code> class, <code>insertElementAt</code> appends to the <code>Vector</code> when the index matches the size of the vector. So you can use <code>insertElementAt(Integer, 0)</code> even when the vector is empty. <ul>To create a node changed event for the root node, specify the parent and the child indices as <code>null</code>.

The form used in ComposeLangSelector lets you select an item in an alt-text array based on the value of its <tt>xml:lang</tt> qualifier. The other form of content addressing is shown in ComposeFieldSelector. \note ComposeLangSelector does not supplant SetLocalizedText or GetLocalizedText. They should generally be used, as they provide extra logic to choose the appropriate language and maintain consistency with the 'x-default' value. ComposeLangSelector gives you an path expression that is explicitly and only for the language given in the langName parameter.

Prints warning messages only when debug level is greater than Debug.ERROR. <b>NOTE:</b> Debugging is an IO intensive operation and may hurt application performance when abused. Particularly, note that Java evaluates arguments to <code>warning()</code> even when debugging is turned off. It is recommended that the debug state be checked by invoking <code>warningEnabled()</code> before invoking any <code>warning()</code> methods to avoid unnecessary argument evaluation and to maximize application performance. If the debug file is not accessible and debugging is enabled, the message along with a time stamp and thread info will be printed on <code>System.out</code>. This method creates the debug file if does not exist; otherwise it starts appending to the existing debug file. When invoked for the first time on this object, the method writes a line delimiter of '*'s. Note that the debug file will remain open until <code>destroy()</code> is invoked. To conserve file resources, you should invoke <code>destroy()</code> explicitly rather than wait for the garbage collector to clean up.

Remove multiple properties from an XMP object. RemoveProperties was created to support the File Info dialog's Delete button, and has been been generalized somewhat from those specific needs. It operates in one of three main modes depending on the schemaNS and propName parameters: Non-empty <code>schemaNS</code> and <code>propName</code> - The named property is removed if it is an external property, or if the flag <code>doAllProperties</code> option is true. It does not matter whether the named property is an actual property or an alias. Non-empty <code>schemaNS</code> and empty <code>propName</code> - The all external properties in the named schema are removed. Internal properties are also removed if the flag <code>doAllProperties</code> option is set. In addition, aliases from the named schema will be removed if the flag <code>includeAliases</code> option is set. Empty <code>schemaNS</code> and empty <code>propName</code> - All external properties in all schema are removed. Internal properties are also removed if the flag <code>doAllProperties</code> option is passed. Aliases are implicitly handled because the associated actuals are internal if the alias is. It is an error to pass an empty <code>schemaNS</code> and non-empty <code>propName</code>.

The value can be anything the server chooses to send. Its value is probably of interest only to the server. The cookie's value can be changed after creation with the <code>setValue</code> method. By default, cookies are created according to the Netscape cookie specification. The version can be changed with the <code>setVersion</code> method.

Test if the given ACI is applicable using the target match information provided. The ACI target can have seven keywords at this time: These two base decision on the resource entry DN: 1. target - checked in isTargetApplicable. 2. targetscope - checked in isTargetApplicable. These three base decision on resource entry attributes: 3. targetfilter - checked in isTargetFilterApplicable. 4. targetattr - checked in isTargetAttrApplicable. 5. targattrfilters - checked in isTargAttrFiltersApplicable. These two base decisions on a resource entry built by the ACI handler that only contains a DN: 6. targetcontrol - check in isTargetControlApplicable. 7. extop - check in isExtOpApplicable. Six and seven are specific to the check being done: targetcontrol when a control is being evaluated and extop when an extended operation is evaluated. None of the attribute based keywords should be checked when a control or extended op is being evaluated, because one of those attribute keywords rule might incorrectly make an ACI applicable that shouldn't be. This can happen by erroneously basing their decision on the ACI handler generated stub resource entry. For example, a "(targetattr != userpassword)" rule would match the generated stub resource entry, even though a control or extended op might be denied. What is allowed is the target and targetscope keywords, since the DN is known, so they are checked along with the correct method for the access check (isTargetControlApplicable for control and isTExtOpApplicable for extended operations). See comments in code where these checks are done.

Returns the DynAny for the component at the current position. It does not advance the current position, so repeated calls to current_component without an intervening call to rewind, next, or seek return the same component. The returned DynAny object reference can be used to get/set the value of the current component. If the current component represents a complex type, the returned reference can be narrowed based on the TypeCode to get the interface corresponding to the to the complex type. Calling current_component on a DynAny that cannot have components, such as a DynEnum or an empty exception, raises TypeMismatch. Calling current_component on a DynAny whose current position is -1 returns a nil reference. The iteration operations, together with current_component, can be used to dynamically compose an any value. After creating a dynamic any, such as a DynStruct, current_component and next can be used to initialize all the components of the value. Once the dynamic value is completely initialized, to_any creates the corresponding any value.

Returns the DynAny for the component at the current position. It does not advance the current position, so repeated calls to current_component without an intervening call to rewind, next, or seek return the same component. The returned DynAny object reference can be used to get/set the value of the current component. If the current component represents a complex type, the returned reference can be narrowed based on the TypeCode to get the interface corresponding to the to the complex type. Calling current_component on a DynAny that cannot have components, such as a DynEnum or an empty exception, raises TypeMismatch. Calling current_component on a DynAny whose current position is -1 returns a nil reference. The iteration operations, together with current_component, can be used to dynamically compose an any value. After creating a dynamic any, such as a DynStruct, current_component and next can be used to initialize all the components of the value. Once the dynamic value is completely initialized, to_any creates the corresponding any value.

Construct a new LoginConfig with default properties.
Returns the DynAny for the component at the current position. It does not advance the current position, so repeated calls to current_component without an intervening call to rewind, next, or seek return the same component. The returned DynAny object reference can be used to get/set the value of the current component. If the current component represents a complex type, the returned reference can be narrowed based on the TypeCode to get the interface corresponding to the to the complex type. Calling current_component on a DynAny that cannot have components, such as a DynEnum or an empty exception, raises TypeMismatch. Calling current_component on a DynAny whose current position is -1 returns a nil reference. The iteration operations, together with current_component, can be used to dynamically compose an any value. After creating a dynamic any, such as a DynStruct, current_component and next can be used to initialize all the components of the value. Once the dynamic value is completely initialized, to_any creates the corresponding any value.

There is a hack here to reverse a hack in RESTLoginView.js. Implementing the code properly in RESTLoginView.js so as to remove this hack will take too long at present, and stands in the way of completion of this module's QR code additions. I have opted to simply reverse the hack in this singular case. In the below code returning the ScriptTextOutputCallback, the String used in its construction is defined as follows: createQRDomElementJS Adds the DOM element, in this case a div, in which the QR code will appear. QRCodeGenerationUtilityFunctions. getQRCodeGenerationJavascriptForAuthenticatorAppRegistration(authenticatorAppRegistrationUri) Adds a specific call to the Javascript library code, sending the app registration url as the text to encode as a QR code. This QR code will then appear in the previously defined DOM element (which must have an id of 'qr'). hideButtonHack A hack to reverse a hack in RESTLoginView.js. See more detailed comment above.

Prints debug and exception messages only when the debug state is either Debug.MESSAGE or Debug.ON. If the debug file is not accessible and debugging is enabled, the message along with a time stamp and thread info will be printed on <code>System.out</code>. This method creates the debug file if does not exist; otherwise it starts appending to the existing debug file. When invoked for the first time on this object, the method writes a line delimiter of '*'s. Note that the debug file will remain open until <code>destroy()</code> is invoked. To conserve file resources, you should invoke <code>destroy()</code> explicitly rather than wait for the garbage collector to clean up. <b>NOTE:</b> Debugging is an IO intensive operation and may hurt application performance when abused. Particularly, note that Java evaluates arguments to <code>message()</code> even when debugging is turned off. It is recommended that the debug state be checked by invoking <code>messageEnabled()</code> before invoking any <code>message()</code> methods to avoid unnecessary argument evaluation and to maximize application performance.

Destroys a DynAny object. This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object. It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy() to avoid resource leaks. Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects (for example, on objects returned by the current_component operation) does nothing. Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it. That is, references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid. Invocations on such references raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST. It is possible to manipulate a component of a DynAny beyond the life time of the DynAny from which the component was obtained by making a copy of the component with the copy operation before destroying the DynAny from which the component was obtained.

Returns the DynAny for the component at the current position. It does not advance the current position, so repeated calls to current_component without an intervening call to rewind, next, or seek return the same component. The returned DynAny object reference can be used to get/set the value of the current component. If the current component represents a complex type, the returned reference can be narrowed based on the TypeCode to get the interface corresponding to the to the complex type. Calling current_component on a DynAny that cannot have components, such as a DynEnum or an empty exception, raises TypeMismatch. Calling current_component on a DynAny whose current position is -1 returns a nil reference. The iteration operations, together with current_component, can be used to dynamically compose an any value. After creating a dynamic any, such as a DynStruct, current_component and next can be used to initialize all the components of the value. Once the dynamic value is completely initialized, to_any creates the corresponding any value.

Instantiates a new JK report exception.
This method validates that the received session ID points to an existing server ID, and the site ID also corresponds to the server ID found in the session. Within this method two "extensions" are of interest: SITE_ID and PRIMARY_ID. The PRIMARY_ID extension contains the hosting server's ID, but only if the given server belongs to a site. The SITE_ID extension contains either the primary site's ID (if the hosting server belongs to a site) or the hosting server's ID. This method will look at the extensions and make sure that they match up with the naming table of this environment. If there is a problem with the session ID (e.g. the server ID actually points to a primary or secondary site, or if the server ID doesn't actually correlate with the site ID), then a SessionException is thrown in order to prevent forwarding of the received session request. A possible scenario for having such an incorrect session ID would be having multiple OpenAM environments using the same cookie domain and cookie name settings.

Destroys a DynAny object. This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object. It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy() to avoid resource leaks. Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects (for example, on objects returned by the current_component operation) does nothing. Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it. That is, references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid. Invocations on such references raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST. It is possible to manipulate a component of a DynAny beyond the life time of the DynAny from which the component was obtained by making a copy of the component with the copy operation before destroying the DynAny from which the component was obtained.

Returns an identity-based set view of the keys contained in this map. The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified while an iteration over the set is in progress, the results of the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal, which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the <tt>Iterator.remove</tt>, <tt>Set.remove</tt>, <tt>removeAll</tt>, <tt>retainAll</tt>, and <tt>clear</tt> methods. It does not support the <tt>add</tt> or <tt>addAll</tt> methods. <p><b>While the object returned by this method implements the <tt>Set</tt> interface, it does <i>not</i> obey <tt>Set's</tt> general contract. Like its backing map, the set returned by this method defines element equality as reference-equality rather than object-equality. This affects the behavior of its <tt>contains</tt>, <tt>remove</tt>, <tt>containsAll</tt>, <tt>equals</tt>, and <tt>hashCode</tt> methods.</b> <p><b>The <tt>equals</tt> method of the returned set returns <tt>true</tt> only if the specified object is a set containing exactly the same object references as the returned set. The symmetry and transitivity requirements of the <tt>Object.equals</tt> contract may be violated if the set returned by this method is compared to a normal set. However, the <tt>Object.equals</tt> contract is guaranteed to hold among sets returned by this method.</b> <p>The <tt>hashCode</tt> method of the returned set returns the sum of the <i>identity hashcodes</i> of the elements in the set, rather than the sum of their hashcodes. This is mandated by the change in the semantics of the <tt>equals</tt> method, in order to enforce the general contract of the <tt>Object.hashCode</tt> method among sets returned by this method.

<p>Receives an HTTP HEAD request from the protected <code>service</code> method and handles the request. The client sends a HEAD request when it wants to see only the headers of a response, such as Content-Type or Content-Length.

Helper method to check if a property is protected or not. We introduce a mechanism to protect certain "core" or "internal" properties from updates via remote SetProperty method of the SessionService. Allowing remote self-updates to session properties leads to a security vulnerability which allows unconstrained user impersonation or privilege elevation. See bug # 4814922 for more information protectedProperties contains a set of property names which can not be remotely updated. It is initially populated using static initializer. We also implemented an extra safety mechanism intended to protect from accidental reopening of this security hole in the future if a property name changes or new property is introduced without corresponding update of the static hardcoded list of protected properties below. This mechanism automatically adds any property to protectedProperties if it is set via local invocation of putProperty. However, some properties (such as Locale and CharSet) must be settable both locally and remotely. In order to make it configurable we use a second table called remotelyUpdateableProperties. Note that protectedProperties takes precedence over remotelyUpdateableProperties: remotelyUpdateableProperties will be consulted only if a property is not on the protectedProperties list already. The following tables defines the behavior of putProperty() and putExternalProperty() depending on whether property name is present in protectedProperties or remotelyUpdateableProperty list protectedProperties remotelyUpdateableProperties putProperty() putExternalProperty() in n/a sets value logs, does nothing out in sets value sets value out out sets value and sets value adds to protectedProperty

Prints messages only when the stats state is either <code>Stats.FILE</code> or <code>Stats.CONSOLE</code>. <b>NOTE:</b> Printing Statistics is an IO intensive operation and may hurt application performance when abused. Particularly, note that Java evaluates arguments to <code>message()</code> even when statistics is turned off. So when the argument to this method involves the String concatenation operator '+' or any other method invocation, <code>isEnabled</code> <b>MUST</b> be used. It is recommended that the stats state be checked by invoking <code>isEnabled()</code> before invoking any <code>message()</code> methods to avoid unnecessary argument evaluation and maximize application performance.

Returns a pool that adaptively decreases its size when idle objects are no longer needed. This is intended as an always thread-safe alternative to using an idle object evictor provided by many pool implementations. This is also an effective way to shrink FIFO ordered pools that experience load spikes. The factor parameter provides a mechanism to tweak the rate at which the pool tries to shrink its size. Values between 0 and 1 cause the pool to try to shrink its size more often. Values greater than 1 cause the pool to less frequently try to shrink its size. The perKey parameter determines if the pool shrinks on a whole pool basis or a per key basis. When perKey is false, the keys do not have an effect on the rate at which the pool tries to shrink its size. When perKey is true, each key is shrunk independently.

Destroys a DynAny object. This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object. It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy() to avoid resource leaks. Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects (for example, on objects returned by the current_component operation) does nothing. Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it. That is, references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid. Invocations on such references raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST. It is possible to manipulate a component of a DynAny beyond the life time of the DynAny from which the component was obtained by making a copy of the component with the copy operation before destroying the DynAny from which the component was obtained.

Otherwise, the data will be copied to the specified file. This method is only guaranteed to work <em>once</em>, the first time it is invoked for a particular item. This is because, in the event that the method renames a temporary file, that file will no longer be available to copy or rename again at a later time.

Returns date that is represented by a string. It uses the following representation of date. yyyy-MM-DD'T'hh:mm:ss based on the following definition of "dateTime" attribute in XML schema which can be found at http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime. A single lexical representation, which is a subset of the lexical representations allowed by [ISO 8601], is allowed for dateTime. This lexical representation is the [ISO 8601] extended format CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss where "CC" represents the century, "YY" the year, "MM" the month and "DD" the day, preceded by an optional leading "-" sign to indicate a negative number. If the sign is omitted, "+" is assumed. The letter "T" is the date/time separator and "hh", "mm", "ss" represent hour, minute and second respectively. Additional digits can be used to increase the precision of fractional seconds if desired i.e the format ss.ss... with any number of digits after the decimal point is supported. The fractional seconds part is optional; other parts of the lexical form are not optional. To accommodate year values greater than 9999 additional digits can be added to the left of this representation. Leading zeros are required if the year value would otherwise have fewer than four digits; otherwise they are forbidden. The year 0000 is prohibited. The CCYY field must have at least four digits, the MM, DD, SS, hh, mm and ss fields exactly two digits each (not counting fractional seconds); leading zeroes must be used if the field would otherwise have too few digits. This representation may be immediately followed by a "Z" to indicate Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or, to indicate the time zone, i.e. the difference between the local time and Coordinated Universal Time, immediately followed by a sign, + or -, followed by the difference from UTC represented as hh:mm (note: the minutes part is required). See ISO 8601 Date and Time Formats ('D) for details about legal values in the various fields. If the time zone is included, both hours and minutes must be present. For example, to indicate 1:20 pm on May the 31st, 1999 for Eastern Standard Time which is 5 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), one would write: 1999-05-31T13:20:00-05:00.

Reads up to len bytes of data from the save buffer or channel buffer into an array of bytes. An attempt is made to read as many as len bytes, but a smaller number may be read. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. If b is null, a NullPointerException is thrown. If off is negative, or len is negative, or off+len is greater than the length of the array b, then an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. If len is zero, then no bytes are read and 0 is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at least one byte. If no byte is available in the save buffer or channel buffer, IllegalBlockingModeException will be thrown; otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into b. The first byte read is stored into element b[off], the next one into b[off+1], and so on. The number of bytes read is, at most, equal to len. Let k be the number of bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in elements b[off] through b[off+k-1], leaving elements b[off+k] through b[off+len-1] unaffected. In every case, elements b[0] through b[off] and elements b[off+len] through b[b.length-1] are unaffected.

Deregister any JDBC drivers registered by the webapp that the webapp forgot. This is made unnecessary complex because a) DriverManager checks the class loader of the calling class (it would be much easier if it checked the context class loader) b) using reflection would create a dependency on the DriverManager implementation which can, and has, changed. We can't just create an instance of JdbcLeakPrevention as it will be loaded by the common class loader (since it's .class file is in the $CATALINA_HOME/lib directory). This would fail DriverManager's check on the class loader of the calling class. So, we load the bytes via our parent class loader but define the class with this class loader so the JdbcLeakPrevention looks like a webapp class to the DriverManager.

standard constuctor.
Start a new Namespace context. The new context will automatically inherit the declarations of its parent context, but it will also keep track of which declarations were made within this context. <p>Event callback code should start a new context once per element. This means being ready to call this in either of two places. For elements that don't include namespace declarations, the <em>ContentHandler.startElement()</em> callback is the right place. For elements with such a declaration, it'd done in the first <em>ContentHandler.startPrefixMapping()</em> callback. A boolean flag can be used to track whether a context has been started yet. When either of those methods is called, it checks the flag to see if a new context needs to be started. If so, it starts the context and sets the flag. After <em>ContentHandler.startElement()</em> does that, it always clears the flag. <p>Normally, SAX drivers would push a new context at the beginning of each XML element. Then they perform a first pass over the attributes to process all namespace declarations, making <em>ContentHandler.startPrefixMapping()</em> callbacks. Then a second pass is made, to determine the namespace-qualified names for all attributes and for the element name. Finally all the information for the <em>ContentHandler.startElement()</em> callback is available, so it can then be made. <p>The Namespace support object always starts with a base context already in force: in this context, only the "xml" prefix is declared.</p>
Attempt to create an XML reader from a class name. <p>Given a class name, this method attempts to load and instantiate the class as an XML reader.</p> <p>Note that this method will not be usable in environments where the caller (perhaps an applet) is not permitted to load classes dynamically.</p>

Create an instance of GreetMeSoundElement
Find the instance of a given class type that is closest to a given instance. This method uses the getParent method from the Tag and/or SimpleTag interfaces. This method is used for coordination among cooperating tags. For every instance of TagAdapter encountered while traversing the ancestors, the tag handler returned by <tt>TagAdapter.getAdaptee()</tt> - instead of the TagAdpater itself - is compared to <tt>klass</tt>. If the tag handler matches, it - and not its TagAdapter - is returned. The current version of the specification only provides one formal way of indicating the observable type of a tag handler: its tag handler implementation class, described in the tag-class subelement of the tag element. This is extended in an informal manner by allowing the tag library author to indicate in the description subelement an observable type. The type should be a subtype of the tag handler implementation class or void. This additional constraint can be exploited by a specialized container that knows about that specific tag library, as in the case of the JSP standard tag library. When a tag library author provides information on the observable type of a tag handler, client programmatic code should adhere to that constraint. Specifically, the Class passed to findAncestorWithClass should be a subtype of the observable type.

Destroys a DynAny object. This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object. It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy() to avoid resource leaks. Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects (for example, on objects returned by the current_component operation) does nothing. Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it. That is, references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid. Invocations on such references raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST. It is possible to manipulate a component of a DynAny beyond the life time of the DynAny from which the component was obtained by making a copy of the component with the copy operation before destroying the DynAny from which the component was obtained.

Marshals from a Map<String,Object> produced by jsonValue.asMap to the Map<String, Set<String>> expected by the SMS. It is tempting to make this generic much more generic, and change the parameter to a JsonValue, as that would preserve the types of the values, and then handle each of the Values differently, depending upon whether the the JsonValue corresponding to the keys is a List, a Set, or a Map (a Map would entail a recursive call). The problem with this approach is that this method cannot know the types of the List and Set, and that many of these types implement custom string parsing schemes, as they must be entered in the AdminConsole. So this method is pretty basic, and works correctly for the primitive value types, but all custom value types must be handled specifically by the marshalToAttributeMap callers.

Construct a new wrapped request around the specified servlet request.
Handles the request in potentially two distinct ways depending on whether a state attribute is found in the request or not. When no state field is found this is an initial request starting the authentication process and the request will have username and password embedded and ready for consumption by the first module in the chain. Any request with a state attribute is a user response to a previous challenge response that we sent back to them in a previously started authentication process. The number of challenge responses that are sent and their corresponding replies is dependent upon the number of modules in the chain and the number of callback fields in each set of callbacks. A set of callbacks represents one grouping of data needed by a module to complete its next step in the authentication process that it implements. This grouping in a web environment constitutes a single page into which a number of fields can receive data. However, to gather additional feedback from a user the radius protocol only supports a challenge response with a text message and state and radius clients typically present that message and a single text input field with a label like, "Answer", and submit and cancel buttons. This means that we only get a single answer per radius challenge response. Therefore, for some callback groupings we will need to return multiple challenge responses before we can submit the callback set's user response values back to the module to take the next step in authentication.

The operation returns true if the resulting current position indicates a component of the DynAny and false if index indicates a position that does not correspond to a component. Calling seek with a negative index is legal. It sets the current position to -1 to indicate no component and returns false. Passing a non-negative index value for a DynAny that does not have a component at the corresponding position sets the current position to -1 and returns false.

Destroys the named context and removes it from the namespace. Any attributes associated with the name are also removed. Intermediate contexts are not destroyed. This method is idempotent. It succeeds even if the terminal atomic name is not bound in the target context, but throws NameNotFoundException if any of the intermediate contexts do not exist. In a federated naming system, a context from one naming system may be bound to a name in another. One can subsequently look up and perform operations on the foreign context using a composite name. However, an attempt destroy the context using this composite name will fail with NotContextException, because the foreign context is not a "subcontext" of the context in which it is bound. Instead, use unbind() to remove the binding of the foreign context. Destroying the foreign context requires that the destroySubcontext() be performed on a context from the foreign context's "native" naming system.

This method is over-ridden from the AbstractTokenInterceptor super-class. The super-class implementation contains logic to prevent the invocation of the AbstractTokenInterceptor#addToken and #processToken methods when the PolicyBasedWSS4JOutInterceptor or PolicyBasedWSS4JInInterceptor are deployed, as in these cases, the interceptors set message state which prevents the AbstractTokenInterceptor from invoking the addToken and processToken methods of subclasses. This is because the PolicyBasedWSS4J*Interceptors are deployed when SecurityPolicy bindings are deployed, and the specific tokens (e.g. UNT, SAMLToken, KerberosToken) are handled by the higher-level SecurityPolicy-related tokens and binding which subsume the specific token types - e.g. the classes in the org.apache.cxf.ws.security.policy.model package, which include classes like the TransportToken, SignatureToken, etc. Over-riding the handleMessage in an AbstractTokenInterceptor sub-class appears to be a viable path for token types with more restricted SecurityPolicy bindings, like the OpenAMSessionToken, which will support only the Transport and 'bare' bindings. Though there are several examples - e.g. the org.apache.cxf.ws.security.wss4j.SamlTokenInterceptor, which is used in the Transport, Symmetric, and Asymmetric bindings, and is a AbstractTokenInterceptor subclass. Given the documentation state of cxf and wss4j, and the complexity of the code-base, this ambiguity cannot be resolved without significant amounts of additional time. If the OpenAMSessionAssertion must be presented over the Symmetric or Asymmetric binding, then this work will be undertaken.
Given an obfuscated description, finds the new values for class names and updates the description.

Creates a new "sharded" load-balancer which will load-balance individual requests across the provided set of connection factories, each typically representing a single replica, using an algorithm that ensures that requests targeting a given DN will always be routed to the same replica. In other words, this load-balancer increases consistency whilst maintaining read-scalability by simulating a "single master" replication topology, where each replica is responsible for a subset of the entries. When a replica is unavailable the load-balancer "fails over" by performing a linear probe in order to find the next available replica thus ensuring high-availability when a network partition occurs while sacrificing consistency, since the unavailable replica may still be visible to other clients. This load-balancer distributes requests based on the hash of their target DN and handles all core operations, as well as any password modify extended requests and SASL bind requests which use authentication IDs having the "dn:" form. Note that subtree operations (searches, subtree deletes, and modify DN) are likely to include entries which are "mastered" on different replicas, so client applications should be more tolerant of inconsistencies. Requests that are either unrecognized or that do not have a parameter that may be considered to be a target DN will be routed randomly. <b>NOTE:</b> this connection factory returns fake connections, since real connections are obtained for each request. Therefore, the returned fake connections have certain limitations: abandon requests will be ignored since they cannot be routed; connection event listeners can be registered, but will only be notified when the fake connection is closed or when all of the connection factories are unavailable. <b>NOTE:</b> in deployments where there are multiple client applications, care should be taken to ensure that the factories are configured using the same ordering, otherwise requests will not be routed consistently across the client applications. The implementation periodically attempts to connect to failed connection factories in order to determine if they have become available again.

wrapLine splits `line` into a list of lines around `length` long at whitespaces. <p>The current implementation - first splits the line into words - adds the words, separated by a single space, to the current line until the line is longer than `length` - and then breaks the line. <p>This implementation has a corner case of `line` containing a word that is by itself longer than `length`. This issue crops up occasionally since many comments contain URLs. Consequently, each wrapped line, except possibly the last, will be slightly longer than `length`. In practice, this is not a serious problem, but this algorithm should be changed if stronger guarantees are required.

Used by both the background thread and the delete post operation to process a delete operation on the specified entry DN. The boolean "log" is used to determine if the DN is written to the log file for the background thread to pick up. This value is set to false if the background thread is processing changes. If this method is being called by a delete post operation, then setting the "log" value to false will cause the DN to be processed in foreground If the DN is to be processed, than each base DN or public naming context (if the base DN configuration is empty) is checked to see if entries under it contain references to the deleted entry DN that need to be removed.

NOTE: this matching rule is used by the "objectClass" attribute type which is frequently used in filters and which is also usually indexed for equality. Unfortunately, it is non-trivial to implement correctly and there are a number of subtleties that need to be understood. Comparing two values for equality ================================= The LDAP RFCs describe the algorithm for comparing assertion values with attribute values, but never discusses how to compare two attribute values for equality in order to detect duplicate or missing values during updates. Given two schema elements: - object class with OID 1.2.3 and name "xxx" - attribute type with OID 4.5.6 and name "xxx" When: - an attribute "oids" whose syntax is OID and which has the value "xxx" Then: - the filter "(oids=1.2.3)" matches, as does "(oids=4.5.6)", as does "(oids=xxx)". However, if the attribute's value is "1.2.3" then only the filters "(oids=1.2.3)" and "(oids=xxx)" match. In order to compare two values with each other when enforcing set semantics in an LDAP attribute we need a function which is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. While the first two are possible, the last is not: - reflexive: 1.2.3 == 1.2.3, xxx == xxx - symmetric: 1.2.3 == xxx, xxx == 1.2.3 - transitive: 1.2.3 == xxx, xxx = 4.5.6, 1.2.3 != 4.5.6 The implication is that it is impossible to implement a reliable normalization method. There are three options: 1) avoid resolving OID names to numeric OIDs during normalization and, instead, convert the OID to lower-case. This approach has the undesirable effect of allowing users to add equivalent object classes to entries. For example, the OIDs "2.5.6.6" and "person" are equivalent, but would have different normalized representations 2) resolve OID names to their equivalent numeric OID. For example, the normalized representation of "Person" would be "2.5.6.6". Unfortunately, there are rare cases where two schema elements share the same name - one can imagine having a custom object class called "manager" which would clash with the standard attribute type "manager". In this situation, the algorithm must choose whether to convert the value to the object class's numeric OID or the attribute type's. Unfortunately, this approach suffers from the same problem as the first if it happens to prioritize the wrong type of schema element 3) as (2) but resolve numeric OIDs to their "primary" OID name. For example, the normalized representation of "2.5.6.6" would be "person". The drawback with this approach is that an OID valued attribute cannot contain two values having the same "primary" name. In the example above, the attribute "oids" cannot contain the values "1.2.3" and "4.5.6" because they both share the same normalized primary name "xxx". Such collisions will be extremely rare in practice because attributes rarely reference a heterogeneous set of schema elements, such as a mix of attribute types and object classes. For example, the "objectClass" attribute should only contain object class OIDs whose names should never collide. Option (3) has been chosen as the normalization strategy as it provides the best compromise. Indexes ======= Indexing poses a different problem because indexes are persistent and rebuilding them is a relatively expensive operation. If index keys depend on the schema, as is the case for the normalization algorithm (3) above, then changes to the schema, e.g. the addition or removal of schema elements, may require an index rebuild. In the above example, changing the primary name of one of the schema elements from "xxx" to "yyy" invalidates any indexes. To avoid the need to rebuild indexes whenever the schema changes we use a simple normalization algorithm - option (1) above - for generating index keys and employ a more complex algorithm for querying the indexes during search operations: 1) compute all the possible aliases of the assertion value's OID using the current schema. In the earlier example, a filter of the form "(oids=xxx)" would yield the keys "xxx", "1.2.3", and "4.5.6", whereas the filter "(oids=1.2.3)" would only yield the keys "1.2.3" and "xxx" 2) perform an exact match index query against the index for each key 3) perform a union of the combined results. This algorithm may yield false positives in very rare cases when the schema contains many schema elements sharing the same name.

The <code>doFilter</code> method of the Filter is called by the container each time a request/response pair is passed through the chain due to a client request for a resource at the end of the chain. The FilterChain passed in to this method allows the Filter to pass on the request and response to the next entity in the chain. A typical implementation of this method would follow the following pattern:- 1. Examine the request<br> 2. Optionally wrap the request object with a custom implementation to filter content or headers for input filtering 3. Optionally wrap the response object with a custom implementation to filter content or headers for output filtering 4. a) <strong>Either</strong> invoke the next entity in the chain using the FilterChain object (<code>chain.doFilter()</code>), 4. b) <strong>or</strong> not pass on the request/response pair to the next entity in the filter chain to block the request processing<br> 5. Directly set headers on the response after invocation of the next entity in the filter chain. This default implementation simply calls the next filter in the filter chain.

<p>Search for all possible partial matches of word starting at index an update interletter values. In other words, it does something like:</p> for(i=0; i<patterns.length; i++) { if ( word.substring(index).startsWidth(patterns[i]) ) update_interletter_values(patterns[i]); } <p>But it is done in an efficient way since the patterns are stored in a ternary tree. In fact, this is the whole purpose of having the tree: doing this search without having to test every single pattern. The number of patterns for languages such as English range from 4000 to 10000. Thus, doing thousands of string comparisons for each word to hyphenate would be really slow without the tree. The tradeoff is memory, but using a ternary tree instead of a trie, almost halves the the memory used by Lout or TeX. It's also faster than using a hash table</p>

This method is called by AuthTargetMapping to marshal the contextMap from the Map<String, Object> returned by the jsonValue.asMap to the Map<String, String> stored by the AuthTargetMapping. The AuthTargetMapping specifies the authIndexType and authIndexValue for each type of token validated by an STS instance, and the contextMap provides any additional context required to consume the rest authN to invoke the particular target defined by the authIndexType and authIndexValue. For example the OpenID Connect ID Token authN module allows the user to specify the header name which will reference the token. This information must be reflected in the AuthTargetMapping if it is to validate OIDC tokens against this authN module. The contextMap is used to provide this information. Because this state must ultimately be stored in the SMS as a String, I cannot store the Map<String,Object> native to json maps, but rather must marshal this representation to a Map<String,String>.

Returns the DynAny for the component at the current position. It does not advance the current position, so repeated calls to current_component without an intervening call to rewind, next, or seek return the same component. The returned DynAny object reference can be used to get/set the value of the current component. If the current component represents a complex type, the returned reference can be narrowed based on the TypeCode to get the interface corresponding to the to the complex type. Calling current_component on a DynAny that cannot have components, such as a DynEnum or an empty exception, raises TypeMismatch. Calling current_component on a DynAny whose current position is -1 returns a nil reference. The iteration operations, together with current_component, can be used to dynamically compose an any value. After creating a dynamic any, such as a DynStruct, current_component and next can be used to initialize all the components of the value. Once the dynamic value is completely initialized, to_any creates the corresponding any value.

Destroys a DynAny object. This operation frees any resources used to represent the data value associated with a DynAny object. It must be invoked on references obtained from one of the creation operations on the ORB interface or on a reference returned by DynAny.copy() to avoid resource leaks. Invoking destroy on component DynAny objects (for example, on objects returned by the current_component operation) does nothing. Destruction of a DynAny object implies destruction of all DynAny objects obtained from it. That is, references to components of a destroyed DynAny become invalid. Invocations on such references raise OBJECT_NOT_EXIST. It is possible to manipulate a component of a DynAny beyond the life time of the DynAny from which the component was obtained by making a copy of the component with the copy operation before destroying the DynAny from which the component was obtained.

Destroys the named context and removes it from the namespace. Any attributes associated with the name are also removed. Intermediate contexts are not destroyed. This method is idempotent. It succeeds even if the terminal atomic name is not bound in the target context, but throws NameNotFoundException if any of the intermediate contexts do not exist. In a federated naming system, a context from one naming system may be bound to a name in another. One can subsequently look up and perform operations on the foreign context using a composite name. However, an attempt destroy the context using this composite name will fail with NotContextException, because the foreign context is not a "subcontext" of the context in which it is bound. Instead, use unbind() to remove the binding of the foreign context. Destroying the foreign context requires that the destroySubcontext() be performed on a context from the foreign context's "native" naming system.

Prints warning messages only when debug level is greater than Debug.ERROR. <p><b>NOTE:</b> Debugging is an IO intensive operation and may hurt application performance when abused. Particularly, note that Java evaluates arguments to <code>warning()</code> even when debugging is turned off. So when the argument to this method involves the String concatenation operator '+' or any other method invocation, <code>warningEnabled</code> <b>MUST</b> be used. It is recommended that the debug state be checked by invoking <code>warningEnabled()</code> before invoking any <code>warning()</code> methods to avoid unnecessary argument evaluation and to maximize application performance.</p>

<p>Is exact matching being used.</p> <p>This rule uses <code>org.apache.commons.beanutils.MethodUtils</code> to introspect the relevant objects so that the right method can be called. Originally, <code>MethodUtils.invokeExactMethod</code> was used. This matches methods very strictly and so may not find a matching method when one exists. This is still the behaviour when exact matching is enabled.</p> <p>When exact matching is disabled, <code>MethodUtils.invokeMethod</code> is used. This method finds more methods but is less precise when there are several methods with correct signatures. So, if you want to choose an exact signature you might need to enable this property.</p> <p>The default setting is to disable exact matches.</p>

When the NameFormat isn't specified in the request, the <code>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:unspecified</code> default NameFormat needs to be used (see SAML core spec 2.7.3.1). The different attribute profiles (SAML profiles spec section 8) each determine how the attribute comparison should be performed, however there is no clear way to actually determine which attribute profile is being used when the Attribute Authority supports more than one profile. Because of this, the unspecified Attribute NameFormat has been implemented as a wildcard match, much similarly to how requesting the unspecified NameID-Format allows the IdP to choose an arbitrary NameID-Format when generating the assertion for an SP.

This is important because the Route has a package-private ctor. Note on transaction semantics: The removal of a previously-published rest-sts instance involves removing the associated route from the CREST router (first step), and then removing the instance state from the SMS (second step). This method lacks the state to re-constitute CREST router state if the SMS modifications fail, and it may be a safe assumption that a removal would want the instance unavailable for invocation first-and-foremost. Nevertheless, it should be possible to invoke this method several times for the same rest-sts instance, in case the LDAP server was down in previous invocations. That means that the lack of a CREST route for a previously-published instance should not prevent the attempted removal of the associated configuration state from the SMS. Note that the consumption of this service is limited to Administrators, so malicious consumption is prevented.

Dispatch incoming result to the correct fragment.
Find the XML node that is the root of the XMP data tree. Generally this will be an outer node, but it could be anywhere if a general XML document is parsed (e.g. SVG). The XML parser counted all rdf:RDF and pxmp:XMP_Packet nodes, and kept a pointer to the last one. If there is more than one possible root use PickBestRoot to choose among them. If there is a root node, try to extract the version of the previous XMP toolkit. Pick the first x:xmpmeta among multiple root candidates. If there aren't any, pick the first bare rdf:RDF if that is allowed. The returned root is the rdf:RDF child if an x:xmpmeta element was chosen. The search is breadth first, so a higher level candiate is chosen over a lower level one that was textually earlier in the serialized XML.

Perform the attributeLevel write rights evaluation. The issue here is that an ACI could contain a targattrfilters keyword that matches the attribute being evaluated. There is no way of knowing if the filter part of the targattrfilter would be successful or not. So if the ACI that allowed access, has an targattrfilter keyword, a "?" is used as the result of the write (depends on attribute value). If the allow ACI doesn't contain a targattrfilters keyword than a "1" is added. If the ACI denies then a "0" is added. If the skipCheck flag is true, then a 1 is used for the write access, since the client DN has bypass privs.

It uses the following representation of date. yyyy-MM-DD'T'hh:mm:ss based on the following definition of "dateTime" attribute in XML schema which can be found at http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime. A single lexical representation, which is a subset of the lexical representations allowed by [ISO 8601], is allowed for dateTime. This lexical representation is the [ISO 8601] extended format CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss where "CC" represents the century, "YY" the year, "MM" the month and "DD" the day, preceded by an optional leading "-" sign to indicate a negative number. If the sign is omitted, "+" is assumed. The letter "T" is the date/time separator and "hh", "mm", "ss" represent hour, minute and second respectively. Additional digits can be used to increase the precision of fractional seconds if desired i.e the format ss.ss... with any number of digits after the decimal point is supported. The fractional seconds part is optional; other parts of the lexical form are not optional. To accommodate year values greater than 9999 additional digits can be added to the left of this representation. Leading zeros are required if the year value would otherwise have fewer than four digits; otherwise they are forbidden. The year 0000 is prohibited. The CCYY field must have at least four digits, the MM, DD, SS, hh, mm and ss fields exactly two digits each (not counting fractional seconds); leading zeroes must be used if the field would otherwise have too few digits. This representation may be immediately followed by a "Z" to indicate Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or, to indicate the time zone, i.e. the difference between the local time and Coordinated Universal Time, immediately followed by a sign, + or -, followed by the difference from UTC represented as hh:mm (note: the minutes part is required). See ISO 8601 Date and Time Formats ('D) for details about legal values in the various fields. If the time zone is included, both hours and minutes must be present. For example, to indicate 1:20 pm on May the 31st, 1999 for Eastern Standard Time which is 5 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), one would write: 1999-05-31T13:20:00-05:00.

Called by the server (via the <code>service</code> method) to allow a servlet to handle a PUT request. The PUT operation allows a client to place a file on the server and is similar to sending a file by FTP. <p>When overriding this method, leave intact any content headers sent with the request (including Content-Length, Content-Type, Content-Transfer-Encoding, Content-Encoding, Content-Base, Content-Language, Content-Location, Content-MD5, and Content-Range). If your method cannot handle a content header, it must issue an error message (HTTP 501 - Not Implemented) and discard the request. For more information on HTTP 1.1, see RFC 2616 <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt"></a>. <p>This method does not need to be either safe or idempotent. Operations that <code>doPut</code> performs can have side effects for which the user can be held accountable. When using this method, it may be useful to save a copy of the affected URL in temporary storage. <p>If the HTTP PUT request is incorrectly formatted, <code>doPut</code> returns an HTTP "Bad Request" message.
