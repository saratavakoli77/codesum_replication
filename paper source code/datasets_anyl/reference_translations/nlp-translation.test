A Republican Strategy to counter Obama’s re-election
Republicans’ leaders justify their policies with the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center holds the latter as a myth, reaffirming that electoral fraud in the US is more rare than the number of people killed by the flash strike.
Republicans’ lawyers have, incidentally, recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for conducting national elections.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have announced new laws since 2009, which make it difficult to process registration or the ballot box.
This phenomenon has become more important after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives could be registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 legislative proposals were introduced in 2011 alone, limiting the exercise of electoral law in 41 countries.
The new electoral laws require voters to submit a photo ID and proof of US citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also shorten the time periods for early voting, declare the right to register as voters on the election day, and grant citizens the right to vote for which a legal act exists.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state asked voters to show a light picture.
Indiana was the first state to demand this.
In 2008, the United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutional legitimacy of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the last two years, in 34 states, they have promoted draft laws that force voters to show a light picture.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal card such as the Health Insurance Card.
Indeed, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government authority of their state.
Moreover, five million new voters do not have such a card in 2012.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often to be paid to get the necessary passport.
The new restrictions have disproportionately affected young people, minorities and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of people with less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years, and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years do not have the required lighting education.
That is even more.
Students who are regarded as voters who are more likely to vote in favour of democratic candidates are not allowed to use their educational channels issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who choose more for the Republican side to use the cards for election issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no federal state called for proof of citizenship for the electorate.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws demanding that voters prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the hispanic voices.
For it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters who prefer democratic parties.
Moreover, in 2011, Republican legislators promoted laws in eight states abolishing voters’ registration on election day.
Moreover, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns on the register of voters in the 2004 general elections have helped to register around 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of the registration of new voters by 17% compared to 2006.
Moreover, Republican legislators in five other states have enacted laws aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African Americans, even though they account for only 13% of the federal voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter made only 11% of voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
By contrast, the white, which represented 76% of voters, accounted for only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws have been blocked by the veto of democratic governors.
The US General Prosecutor intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring the use of a light-image card.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the laws adopted, and see them as a clear objective of influencing the results in the states that are crucial to 2012.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that those states that passed these laws make 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral Panel to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the US democratic system.
prostate cancer early: should the test be made or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes displays incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
This will lead to stronger hesitations on the already undecided men to carry out screening tests.
Should the test be made or not?
We have obtained the opinion of two specialists.
The studies carried out in the US have had numerous disruptions between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that, after 12 years of observation, the probability of metastasis formation is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been carried out.
That is why I recommend the test from a age of 50 or 40 years, if you have a direct relative who has already been affected by prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk in men of afro-American origin.
The most important thing is to take the right decision as soon as cancer has been identified.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The extent of the risk of cancer must be made perfectly understandable to the patient by pointing out the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain unaffected if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term and, in these cases, it is more likely that the disease should be monitored actively.
Today, many men who have been identified with cancer do not receive treatment, because their cancer is not aggressive and is not a threat to their lives.
They are offered active monitoring and treatment in the course of the disease.
With increasing accuracy, one determines the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who not.
That is why I recommend that the tests be carried out.
The most important thing, however, is to talk to his doctor to determine whether or not he should be carried out.
In cooperation with the International Society for Urology, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.
This document (currently only in English, but a translation will be available shortly) can be downloaded at http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening screening.
Prevention of the Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer could be prevented if everyone were to eat well and move enough.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would increase at least to 50% ," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancer is caused by cancer.
A number of people remain completely unaffected.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the drop in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It greatly damage human health.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after smoking the cigarette, the risk of dying cancer decreases by half.
The Weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, obesity and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, finger, mast, oesophagus, pancreas and cervical cancer.
"Research shows that a regular physical activity protects against influenza cancer throughout life," he adds.
The Food
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of developing a flu or mast cancer.
The hotel is located in the center of the city.
The preservation of meat by wheels, dryers or salt can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the connection between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, your investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to the Canadian cancer society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly shown.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family discharge.
'The carrying out of a screening test does not lead to cancer'.
The Higgs-Boson analyzes the Higgs-Boson.
Last summer, the announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs-Boson has aroused some excitement, for good reason.
It is indeed believed that this Boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
Finally, it is the last part, whose existence was predicted by the standard model - our best or "least false" declaration of nature and the behavior of matter, but not yet observed empirically.
But for the physicists it is not yet fully certain that this is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new part, and that it is very similar to the Higgs-Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still a lack of data to be completely safe.
Nevertheless, let us assume that this is actually the higgs, since there seems to be only a small risk of deceiving, and let us look at what is at stake.
There is an inevitable law in this world, which means that two objects cannot be present at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and don't try it too strong as you are wet.
For even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that it also applies to such a law: the Pauli's exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same room at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state", whereby this "state" is largely made up of some of their properties.
From this point of view, the physicists share the particles in two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and are obeyed artistically by the Pauli principle.
And in the other are the Bosons, a wicked band of anarchists, who are not holy - certainly not this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosses are divided into two groups according to The Particle Adventure website by the Berkeley laboratories (which is quite astonishing by the way), the mesons that we will not be dealing with here and the "power particles" that spread the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs-Boson would be somehow related.
However, it must be emphasised here that these bosses are not all as exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boss of extraordinary banality: the Photon or the "light particle" which is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
After all, if a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" precisely in this place, such as a pebble stone thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc. ), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the bosses "carrier of power".
Stabilere field
The same applies to the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disrupted" so that this boss shows itself.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be crushed by a very large rock.
That is why a huge particle accelerator like CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km! - to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the masses.
Indeed, it is not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold from itself to the fridge.
And equally, not all parts interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while others (like the Photon) have no mass.
For what can all these research be "good", asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, they are used to check the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physicists to examine carefully all deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
There are also many physicists who hope most sincerely that such deviations will be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the model.
One has to say that the latter still has great defects, since it does not provide a explanation for gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which is about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, the CERN has not yet found such deviations.
Impact
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no one.
By the way, in the early 1960’s, the laser’s pioneers in the Bell labs did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the deceased physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who, in 1962, developed the first permanent laser (the first one was sprayed), has already told us that the laser was initially regarded as a "laboratory game".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also be made from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, in 1969 Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and brought him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that LHC's activities will necessarily change our lives, but it means that you can never know it...
Palliativpflege - the best way to die... | Le Devoir
With her committee on 'Death in dignity', Quebec recently discussed the thorny issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this in more detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived only in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that he had raised had allowed him a two-year period.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, in his bed in the house for palliative maintenance Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived on the previous day.
"However, it is always a shock, you cannot be prepared for that," he says.
The disease does its work: an immense weakness prevents it from going to the toilet alone and even eating itself.
Seating at the table before a delicious lunch, he resigns himself to be able to help with food.
He bravely manages even to smile and talk to the strangers who are around him, bringing his medicines to him, and offering him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is to heal my diarrhea, as this is humiliating," he shares.
A few hours later the team found a remedy for this evil.
"In the course of our life we learn that a man is pinkelt in standing", says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in Heim Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to childhood is unacceptable for certain people.
"That depends on the person's ability," he notes a step backwards.
Because, according to several people who work in Palliative Care, great events are taking place in the midst of these setbacks.
The patients who are admitted to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overhauled by the doctors and nurses who care about them with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., 89 years, the worst fear is 'to die consciously and through initial suffocation'.
But through the disease, I really got to know my children.
"I have good children," adds them.
"I don't have any wishes in life anymore," she says before she accepts that you set up a mask that helps her with breathing.
In the next few days, she is still awaiting a recent visit to her son from Italy.
In the home Victor-Gadbois, you can use a group of volunteers to maintain body care and help you with food intake.
The palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make the dying more pleasant.
In Quebec there is a bed for palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
This is very little given that we will all die one day.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the nurses of the home.
At the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
You grant a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi depending on your wishes.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we served Mr X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will burn the beer to the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," reports the nursing director Nathalie Savard.
In the home Victor-Gadbois is not a day like the other.
Alongside an old man of 93 years, who enjoys the last family meeting in the courtyard and is well supported by his pillows while being insulted to his honor, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two small children, dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
"For six months three to five beds have always been filled with cancer patients of less than 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois come from their homes, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative maintenance
It is said that 77% of the Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care to alleviate the suffering of patients if the latter have reached the final stage of their life, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Heim Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Maintenance in the Montreal area, specialize more or less exclusively on caring for cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec’s healthcare services that causes several doctors specialised in palliative care to face concerns about adopting a law governing euthanasia and assisting suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulated, signed by prominent personalities of palliative care, such as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health-care system is not powerful enough to ensure that all the right to high-quality palliative care before you accept moving to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I have seen a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency, without taking measures to alleviate them.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate healthcare.
And, at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst predictions, by the last day.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal when she cut off a painful chemotherapy.
When I informed my oncologist that I would cancel the treatment, she replied to me that she regrets that I raised the fight, told her.
However, she told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotente care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die, thank the nursing staff, that it did not meet this desire after their pain had been relieved by a Palliativpflege team.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
After Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care of the society of home palliative care of the Montreal metropolitan area, 8% of patients do not speak on pain treatment.
Thus, at the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which amounts to either sporadic or permanent injury to the patient until his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly be able to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain will not be relieved say all the same sentence: 'I want to die'.
But this does not necessarily mean "I want you to take me" but "I want my pain to be alleviated".
The implementation of this report was possible on the basis of a journalistic agency of Canadian health research institutions.
Real estate scandals of great proportions in Quebec
Civil servants of the roadbuilding office, companies in the construction industry, money procurers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell each day what they know about a great "system" in which the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are embroiled.
An "industry" that was very expensive to the taxpayer of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system is broken since drastic measures have been taken", joins Jacques Duchesneau, Deputy Member of Quebec and former head of the police in Montreal.
The scandal was revealed by him because of a thorough investigation of the misappropriation in connection with the contracts on road works in Quebec, which the then prime minister reluctantly agreed to.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the start of the inquiry in 2010," he emphasized, "the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars in the Treaties," because some have pulled their instinct to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission 'has already brought two mayors to fall', adds, in the hope that it will succeed in 'showing the tactics behind the individuals'.
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, launched in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops to auditors, investigators, and government analysts.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau-Truppe" who have been working since 2009 to ensure that the "canalisation cartel" of Montreal is more restrained in terms of the artificial paralysis of the contracts...
Over the last few weeks, she has carried out a series of house searches and raised accusations of fraud and corruption against local officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
It is suspected to have repeatedly received bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Incidentally, the Montreal roadbuilding office engineers, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were heavily charged.
The latter has attracted attention by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the 'system' for the receipt of public contracts.
For several years, he has paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a mediator associated with the Mafia, who transferred the money to the Union of Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito has had his hand in the game throughout the 2000s, giving more than USD 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately EUR 68,000) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were then in power.
He also designed to have organised illegal funding for former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Channel contracts, whose costs have been artificially inflated by him.
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail to the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, and bribes of $736,000 in return for Channel contracts, whose costs he artificially inflated.
Other officials of the roadbuilding office admitted that they could be forgiven by artificially inflating the invoices with false additional services by 30-40%.
Moreover, an organiser of the Mayor’s Party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of intentionally overlooking a shadow budget that filled his coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal who raised the alarm.
As Mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, from 2010 she refused to sell a municipal circuit that was purchased for $5 million and sold for $1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in electoral campaigns
It says from the investigation, which is ultimately carried out, that it 'draws on a thread that allows us to understand the functioning of the system subjected to ants, in order to stop the evil and to denounce the culprits'.
It says that the procedure is 'painful but positive'.
We are about to clean up the wounds, but we need an investigative unit only for Montreal, and supervision to prevent the return of dubious practices.
The room was clean and comfortable.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, acknowledges that "officials have stolen several hundreds of millions of dollars," but is thinking, above all, of the role of "officials who are involved in the tactics in the picture" if they were not involved in the fraud!
On the basis of a 70% black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he joins: "I have been told that this is just a weak corner of reality."
The Quebec Government proposes to limit contributions to parties to $100, according to which it would not change the situation: 'Until the campaign spending is strictly limited, black money will be circulated in politics.'
It recommends a complete review of the system for awarding public contracts and the financing of the parties: 'We cannot fall deeper by taking the courage to do so, we can rebuild the House on a more solid basis with more controls and laws'.
If that story is detrimental to Quebec's international standing and to that of Montreal, Mr Duchesneau calls on those who laugh to take a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you have taken a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
I make progress on her side every day.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements teach me daily to improve my level of play.
And in a game this is even easier.
In football everything goes very fast.
But I don't bother me with enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine up to my playing time on Saint-Etienne, I have made progressive progress.
You can take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new entrances of this summer are used to exchanging high levels of games.
You also know that every training unit is crucial.
This will result in a player like me, who needs to offer pencils and wants to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in relation to my playing position.
He is supported by Co-Trainers like Claude Makelele, who played on the same position as I did.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti gives all technicians respect.
There is currently no comparable person in league 1, and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also a statement for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of the top rider.
However, we are lying in the back.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified ourselves in this way for the Eighth Elves.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on everything is possible.
However, we will have to talk about very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become the first of our group before Porto, so that we can play the game of the Eight Elves as a home game.
Can the PSG become a great European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for this...
In order to become a great European club, Paris must win titles and make a long-term name.
This is not the case today.
In financial terms, the PSG is giving itself the means to take concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year we are really keen to take this title.
In the last season we were tight.
In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough to win.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have reached 79 points.
Normally you should be champions with 79 points...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Although the big teams, such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, are bringing the title, I believe that we have the witness to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
But if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something you can accuse us of, that is certainly a bit frustrating.
One wonders what people still expect.
We could never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We are trying to establish a game concept.
A team builds on time.
We have shown strength in the Champions League.
Look at Manchester City, a club that has not been able to qualify for the Eighth inal, and which has also made huge spending!
With regard to the sums invested, you thought you had a break with 15 points!
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be disregarded.
Lyon and Marseilles, who were not good in the last season, were "booted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that, in May, we will be the smiling winner in May and that we will say that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won them.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So better to talk about a "Zlatan dependency".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many gates.
That is why he has come and he proves that he is the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages the others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also makes it possible for everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French National Team?
As a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from doing some game time.
I have seen things from which I have emerged stronger.
Today, I managed to realize good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
We have learned from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we have to show exemplary behaviour.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
It has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the Qualification Group for the World Cup.
The national trainer is strict, is close to the player and encourages victory.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualified us for the EM.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is the decision imposed on Spain on 16 October (1:1) a start game?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone has worked for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain I never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without bank.
The opposite of current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as is often the case in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the belief that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, is leading to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros, etc. ) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the Bitcoin rate reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, he fell to $2 five months later, before recovering today on about $10 (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive in relation to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Yet the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the traditional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies like the "credits" used to make progress in a video game that you can win or buy through games (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, each time trade is controlled and processed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all net nodes are simultaneously depositors of the accounting book, auditors, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of data associated with this transaction is electronically signed by a dual encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bit coins are available in the public accounts accounts that are common throughout the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task launched on computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, privileged to add this additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computer "take" the new transaction and add a number before the whole is "hacked".
The aim is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zero at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay two times very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated from the network and the other will remain without any link, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 bit coins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to one hundred millionth, which leaves a certain amount of room for manoeuvre...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with every improvement in the computing performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and lows.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin insoles stolen.
"The vulnerabilities used do not affect the actual protocol," said Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Important actors like Wikipedia refuse to donate this type.
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analysed the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of the bit coins are not circulated.
In November a "mega-final sale" was started.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," joins Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts Bitcoin into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by traders, and the latter must not install new terminals or computer programs.
You simply have to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in revising hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time to get through Bitcoin, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
By the way, the ECB proposes in its report to re-evaluate the various risks currently regarded as high in the event of this currency's success.
We have withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are likely to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain the possession of its territory, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
We have punished the Afghan farmers in particular by treating them as terrorists.
And to ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and sent.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of farmers who refuse to have an armed foreign presence, such as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they have joined jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks, and Tajics.
Tolerance, sometimes supported by local insurgents, will no longer be there if the Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I have observed from a hill planted with almond trees, financed by French loans, was carried out properly.
The lorry and tanks convoyed by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since their irresistible march from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was overrun by the war due to the struggles of the various insurgent groups.
Their takeover of power was regarded as a kind of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al Qaeda organisation, but their situation has not improved so far.
Former Mujahedin, the Afghan government, and the current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen by confiscating government plots to sell them as a land of refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from massive American subcontraction.
They brought themselves into disrepute, and most of them were not involved in the struggles themselves.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just as those who have been able to benefit from American subsidies: capital flight is considerable.
Young people have been fed up with war and ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain executives will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which is a modern world, is being looked at everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Will the authorities under which they are under command be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province that will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from a degree of decentralisation in the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the prime minister’s office, which existed since the constitution of 1964, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially in the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, since the 1950s, his country has long been dependent on foreign aid.
Industries were not rebuilt, functional dust works are not present and important irrigation systems were not repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country which was at the root of the war of 30 years, it would have been necessary to have state control over infrastructures.
The rumour has been spread that Afghanistan has immense land resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to seize it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore locally, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, leaving the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) on the huge Buddhist site to make their excavations and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and young engravings, Institute for French at universities, French Institute, Cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military action" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has been carried out in dozens of mountain villages numerous non-profit works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture and carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to "win heart and spirit" and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
These work, for which many local workers were required, could help to suppress the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural land use.
What kind of souvenir do we leave after military spending of EUR 2 billion?
A much more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often at a height of more than 2000 metres.
There have been dozens of written questions from small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, which, according to their own statements, is their wish, the continuation of small, well-controlled and directly-related civilian aid in their favour would be necessary.
A Constitution with the Bread in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains divided more than ever in relation to the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited power, it has decided to put everything on a map.
To the surprise of everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly will adopt its final version on the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of his work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been relying on a provisional, multi-pronged text, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only created an even greater division of the country.
For his adversaries, the president is stuck in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "trample the law".
On the side of his supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time that forces the brothers to refrain from their project to explain to the Egyptians the text section for section.
It is also a way for the President to find his public and democratic legitimacy while the protest is raging throughout the country.
After reaffirming in an interview with the American Weekly Show Time, Mohammed Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
With this intervention, the Egyptian people will be given an ultimatum to a hasty vote: 'Either they vote in favour of my draft or I maintain the unlimited power of authority', the latter should, after the Constitution has been adopted, supposedly put an end to it.
85 largely Islamist members of this constituent assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals have not responded to the request.
Shortly before the mid-November constitutional declaration, they turned away, because they believe that they have not been able to assert their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve the quorum, 11 people, deputy members, were added in all haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Moslem brothers.
It is no surprise that the articles were generally adopted unanimously.
The commentators also found it funny that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed during the period of prayer, as some members of the committee thought that the Pendeluhr of the constituent assembly did not go very well.
The text that was adopted last night consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew attention to itself, ultimately remains the same as that of the 1971 Constitution and states that 'the principles of Sharia law are the main source of justice'.
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of replacing 'the principles' with 'the rules', which would have made it possible to apply more strictly.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is proof of their goodwill and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
"hypocrisy" is what the Liberals regard as a propaganda strike.
They say that the constitution is being Islamicized through other articles.
In particular, they have Article 220 in mind, which provides an advisory function to the University of Al-Azhar, particularly in relation to the verification of conformity with the laws of Sharia law.
According to the Egyptians' specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing, as 'the people who are called for an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy here".
Liberals’ fears are also fed by the fact that the next rebate of this university will be far less moderate than the one we have at the moment.
"At the moment, no concrete religious commitment can be seen.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics, some of whom have been educated in the French system, summoned Alexis Blouet, who writes a PhD on Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, it acknowledges that 'there can be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are exempt from the religious vocabulary.
This refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, Anm d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to what extent civil judges are competent to decide on it.'
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised for the far-reaching powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argue that they are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention is the powers of the army.
In line with the military’s desire, the review of the defense budget is not presented to Parliament, but to a national defense council.
Nor will there be a ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as requested by the human rights associations.
The latter also share their concerns about the text they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The blasphemy affair is maintained and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article refers to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the ban on torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While Egyptian President had to speak on television yesterday evening, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The heads of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy places, the world’s nabel, and a sea of Sole in Israel.
The Gelobte Land unites the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and an untouched nature.
AIF gives you the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Protect against the holy places
Visit the River Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galiläa is the place where Jesus accomplished his miracles: the transformation of water into wine on a wedding ceremony, walking on the water, the silence of the lake storm and fishing.
Just here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the sanctuaries, however, are found in Jerusalem.
Believers are here celebrating the suffering path or the cross-road of Jesus Christ (on Latein: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the Old Town to the tomb church on Mount Golgotha, where the intercession point, the Salbungsstein and the Jesu tomb are located.
It is in the Christian view of the nabel of the world that symbolises the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree grew from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place of the Jews - the Knights, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, there people of different faiths leave Zettel with desires who then go to fulfilment.
A journey up to the altitude
The ruins of the Massada fortress form the remnants of the secret hiding from enemies who built Herod of the Great in the year 25 AD for his family.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins of their own power.
All the others bring a cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, at 1600 to 2040 meters above sea level, is the famous ski area Hermon, where it attracts countless tourists during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can reach it by a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometres.
According to an old legend, allegedly pagan gods lived on the summit.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
In just one trip you cannot visit all of them.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be visited.
The Israel Museum is also close to the Knesset (Parliament).
There are old Qumrano manuscripts or scrolls from the dead sea found in rock caves in the Judean desert, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited there.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several rooms of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the then visitors and bathers.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Entry is free and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum and Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells us of one of the most shocking chapters of history.
The most exciting department is the monument for the children built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room there is total darkness.
Stars spark.
And it beheld the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something about health
The three main recreation areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceans.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also kept in the winter months, as the water temperature is not below 21°C and the air is warmed up to 23°C.
The dead sea is even warmer and the whole year is kept there.
Incidentally, this unusual sea with a location of 417 metres below sea level is the deepest sea of the world.
Its turquoise water has a high salt content, making it even less difficult to wear on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is incredibly beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatment using salt water (natural salt sole) and mud, as well as for treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease and soothing strayed nerves.
The Secrets of Ageing touching
These secrets are the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous lakeshore, which connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his Arche precisely here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda with which he led a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists are happy to stroll through the narrow streets named after the star signs.
Fortuna is supposed to be the legend after all hold that touches the walls in the street with its star sign.
In Jaffa you can meet new married couples from all over Israel and even other countries on photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herodes, you can walk through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judaea and residence of the Roman statutes, including Pontius Pilatus.
In the carefully restored theatre, evening concerts and operas are performed nowadays.
Note list for tourists
If you travel to Israel, don't worry about your poor English skills: approximately 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the journey is better not to take in euros, but in dollars that can easily be converted into cheques (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 cheque).
Most of the city is by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a motorway and in Haifa the only subway line in the country with six stations connecting the suburb with the Upper Town.
In fact, it is a underground cable car.
A journey within the city costs 6 cheques, regardless of the traffic, including a change for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbat is celebrated in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants, only the food is served, which excludes pork meat, marine products, fish without sheep and food containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with hammer and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish Humus Paste, various sauces, fried bakeries made of roasted beans and vegetables (haafel).
There are no stray dogs in Israeli cities.
There are many well-nourished cats that stray comfortably and safely through the streets.
In the evening you can see them even sleeping on the roofs parking cars.
The cats like animated places and do not say no to pastries.
A rental car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And bicycle rental costs 15 cheques per day.
Tickets for museums cost 30 cheques on average.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and tourists came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Gelobte country, corresponding to an increase of 51% compared to the 2010 comparative period, prior to the visa waiver on February 9, 2011.
"The big and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money on language.
While MEPs and civil rights activists are discussing the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already trading with forged certificates.
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is to make money for the maintenance of the families left in the home.
On 1 December, a law came into force, according to which each migrant worker must submit a test certified by Russian language knowledge.
Until now, this regulation only applies to migrants who want to work in the services sector, in the local housing sector and in the retail sector.
However, the tests are to become compulsory for all guest workers in the future, according to the Federal Migration Agency.
Not only must language tests be carried out, but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills must be shown both for the preservation and extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is official.
This law also excludes people who received their training certificates and diplomas prior to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Sinn, problematic and protection of rights
The whole of the examination bodies will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of Ethnology, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can carry out tests in all cities; more than 160 centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Agency.
On the other hand, before the law enters into force in the press, civil rights activists asked the following question several times: what does it actually bring?
What changes does the requirement to have language skills, both for Russians and for guest workers?
In particular, the answer to the spokesman for the migration agency is to reduce the number of forced labour.
"Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Federal Migration Agency in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must be protected from their departure.
Only organised recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
There are problems with migrants without jobs, education, language skills and medical examination.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without linguistic knowledge will inevitably encounter those with bad intentions who put him in a dark, tight bark on the pretext of help, where he will stay with dozens of one-hour months without food and documents and create 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home country you will be promised one, and on arrival you will be deceived, will receive your passports and will not receive the promised wage", confirms the head of the main administration for labour migration of the Tajian migration agency, Tolib Schwaripow.
Not shake, bosses!
Yet many of the citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to make their money in Russia admit that not only do they not manage the language of the destination country, but they can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmans, Uzbeks and Tajics can afford only reasonable primary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed children, let alone buy decent clothes, shoes and school clothes.
As a teenager, these children take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It is difficult without language knowledge", give them.
'You feel humiliated and inferior.'
Civil rights defenders stress the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status must be tested.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers remain illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "forbidden entry for unauthorised persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalisation costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A falsified registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The Russian police are aware that our documents are largely falsified and we are not registered, and then there are cases of blackmail.
"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea", says Tajique Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
"Don't waste any costs on false papers."
Already on the day the law came into force, it emerged that not only the migrant registration documents can be falsified.
Some falsified certificates, which certify the absorption of the language test, have already been imposed by members of the Federal Migration Agency.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get it for free: every migrant who hoped to save the tests paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that certificates cannot be bought simply, is shared by both officials and civil rights activists.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they will be given time for a language course.
Moreover, newcomers are offered without language skills in areas where there is no need for active understanding with people.
Interior ministry ignores the illegal arms market
Participation of legal weapons in criminal offences
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning to tighten up the arms law for private arms owners.
In this way, the authorities are reacting to recent events: injured in shooting on weddings and seven dead in the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in the public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption Fight, Irina Jarowaja, has supported the proposal and promised that the changes to the arms law will soon be submitted to the Duma.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by 'seizing screws'.
On the Internet, an open letter was published, whose author - representatives of various arms associations - called on the authorities to refrain from 'pointless tightening up'.
Most of the crimes with registered weapons are very low, the criminal law , Wasilij Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes have been committed in 2012, with the use of the registered weapons over six months, while a total of 1.168 thousand offences have been recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening up the law for private arms owners will not prevent criminals from serving on the black market.
At the moment, according to the authors in Moscow, every possible weapon can be found for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: From factories to officers
The weapons reach the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked ten years in the Ministry of Education and at the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts arms orders.
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both Russian officers and the Caucasus themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel there are illegal weapons stolen by the police of criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from the police and directly from the criminal prosecution authorities.
Further illegal weapons come from military weapons camps.
There have often been explosions in many military camps.
"There is evidence that some cases were arson to cover up the lack of weapons," said the former military officer.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers are also contributing to the black market.
"Nowadays, there are countless private armaments factories that do not stand up to international competition and therefore squander arms under the black market, for example in Moscow", reports the expert.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many pistols and guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a separate, sometimes artisanal production as well as a mafia that organizes smuggling", explains the former military officer.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels involved in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was drawn up by the Centre for Problems Analysis and Government Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Statistical Service, Criminological Literature and publicly accessible data on the subject of weapons portals.
According to the investigators, the vast majority of illegal weapons come from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all arms on the black market are there by 'guilty of those who have been involved in their work with weapons', the report states.
According to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict zones, 14% go back to theft in the production of weapons, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant of an arms lady who does not want to be named by name, assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long been bought by no one since they are out of date.
According to him, it is more common for traders to get the supply in a stockpile.
A weapon, for example a gun of the type TT, is purchased via a ferry rod.
The weapon is issued and handed over by the fence.
"The trader brings the weapon to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines", he tells him.
"The police are, of course, aware of everything and therefore, if they fail to comply with the plan for detecting crimes, they periodically carry out checks on traders offering illegal weapons," adds the sales consultant.
"As in the luxury shop."
Purchasers and sellers are most often found by acquaintances to each other.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone was attentive to me and suggested to come to the station "Begowaja" where a person would wait for me, who would put me in a place where we could negotiate the price.
I only got the price for the weapon there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"In order to obtain a weapon, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a friend but I don't trust him".
There are traders on the markets, but you have to go there and talk to you with a code like "Iwan Iwanowitsch, who allows the daughter to have lost a tooth".
I am now even coming to some rings about a friend I trust.
He also gives me the rings only because he knows that I don't whip him.
New people are searching for weapons in various ways.
The former military officer Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he wrote an article on this subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was shown.
"I felt like in the luxury store", recalls the military officer.
According to Baranez, the purchaser does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy but go to the forest with the seller, and there we set a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other", the expert describes the action.
Purchasing from the Sofa
Internet search engines show search results on web pages and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
There is no need for any paper or personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate sum of money", it is stated in the advertisement on the website "Purchasing combat gun or gun".
There, users place their orders and ask questions.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without license", asks users "Iwan" (literally quote).
"Buy a TT Moscow", is the laconic request from "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless false pages, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the service on the net.
People come like hungry fish in feeding and then land in Siberia and may cast coal.
Military commentator and former military officer Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following schema: the website is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
Those responsible accept orders.
The purchaser transfers the money via a ATM.
"As an answer he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon", the press spokesman of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can finally go out empty and get behind bars if you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless false pages, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the service on the net.
"People come like hungry fish in feeding and then land in the Siberian labour camp and may cast coal," he says.
A Makarow for $100
When buying illegal firearms, experts estimate prices of $100 to $900.
According to Dmitrij Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a pistol of the type Makarow for 100 to 300 dollars.
We have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is spent in military arms camps of middle-range guardians.
According to official statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, the number of illegal weapons offences in Russia fell by 7% to 22.9 thousand in the period from January to October 2011, while the number of cases of theft and blackmail related to weapons, ammunition, explosives, and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the US, fast-food and supermarket workers strike strike.
Each fourth American youth is sometime behind Mc Donald's's coffers.
Over the past few days, there have been massive protests across the US against low wages in stores of Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests will go further, or whether they are coming back soon.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and Fast-Food workers, the protest organizers are pursuing the aim of setting up trade unions.
Up to now, this industry has hardly been organised in the trade union.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the United States, attracting millions of customers, sometimes resulting in handling.
On that day, some Walmart workers, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and punished branches of the chain, together with unions and left-wing activists, whose target group is low and middle-income.
Walmart sells all products, from winds to hunting guns and car batteries to dust cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart branches are between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the low paid Walmart employees only buy in their own jobs.
The prices and the range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods only so cheaply, because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, such as the lack of forklift or handscanners.
The participants of the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to their own health insurance had risen from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee, who earned $9.5 an hour, cannot afford this increase, said it.
Researchers from Californian University in Berkeley show that if the company increased its average wage to $12, it would cost $3.2 billion.
These are about 1.1% more than they are now donating to pay.
If Walmart were to complete the wage increases to customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cent more in the future.
Each year, they would spend only $12.39 in comparison with today.
Supporters of Walmart are pleased to note that only nine states have protested and that they have not incurred any losses to the company.
The Black Friday took the next day in his store from 8 am on Thursday to midnight, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 articles per second.
In total, the Walmart cassettes at the Black Friday resulted in almost 100 million transactions.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees had set up the work and the protest was merely "another PR trick" by the trade union that organized the protests.
'Free Cash!'
The protests continued this week in New York, but their goal was not Walmart stores (which are not desirable in this advanced city and therefore inexistent) but McDonald's and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company sells billions of Portions, yet you don't get sick, and you won't pay for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is increased gradually, but not too strong, and on average, their simple staff in New York get $8.90 an hour.
Less than it does not deserve anyone in this expensive city.
I find it incomprehensible how it is possible to spend so little money in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American youths were behind the clock after McDonald's's school, but young people still lived with their parents.
Almost one saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's staff, I am constantly encountering people who complain that they have to pay for this salary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal’s Forum, whose author points out that it is irresponsible to get children if you don’t know how to feed them.
The protests that began on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of McDonald's in 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that the cashier and chefs of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15, which is more than doubling the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
The US law forbids corporate governance to stand in the way of this goal and to urge or dismiss union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high personnel fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
There were strong protests this day even before many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting at midday before McDonald's at Times Square, where some local democrats spoke, including city councillor Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick, and you won't pay for your honest work!"
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York democrats, for example, Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that 'we should jointly support the fast-food workers so that they can maintain a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New York deserves'.
According to New York Times, this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the US fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people on the ground, most of whom are far from all employed in the fast food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"The brain can only be superimposed to date."
In recent times, the theme of the enlarged reality, which is popular with supporters of modern technologies, is usually perceived by the lens of a special glasses.
First, in the summer, at its annual conference, Google presented a functioning model, and in November it became known that Microsoft had also filed an appropriate patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it becomes clear that the glasses for the company's scientists were only a transit station.
It irritates the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with simple hands and creating virtual spaces.
- Please specify briefly which research your group operates.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
Until now, mankind has remained largely in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
However, we want to look forward to 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What do we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much remains on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) has been improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We try to change this, work on real three-dimensional representation systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We must release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
It is necessary to recognize not only the user but also his environment.
Then we could add the real world much more easily to virtual objects.
First of all, we should get rid of this dedicated virtual reality helmet!
- What do you think about voice control?
It is popular, but is it not overvalued?
- It is certainly not the end-of-life solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform all those involved about his actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each one in their particular niche.
For example, in the area of controlling objects on public places we worked on a project in which we experimented with short and short, rather than with external gestures.
The gestures were recorded not by the object camera but by an arm band that registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, overall, the future is mixed tax types, such as gestures and language.
- How is that?
- We would ask you, for example, to offer you these spraying diamonds?
You say it and you point it at the same time.
- Normally I just say it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to see.
- Does that mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at the appropriate time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but this is a question of mutual approximation.
I think that, in the near future, we will have to work above all on the development of new types of sensor, which will enable people to react more accurately.
This can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- Which requirements do you take from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors to modern cameras?
Does it lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 Megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the Megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In this way, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of algorithms have more work.
Not only must the resolution be taken into account along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of the human being are extremely dynamic and frankly said, the current 30 fps are not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our laboratory in Redmond with a customizable processing delay of between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction of man and machine.
For my work I needed a device, only without touch control and with more frames per second.
- Do you not need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It does not serve to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras may solve the problem...
Or increase the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, cinema-like system in which we could play with different camera types to see how this helps us in the three-dimensional analysis of a position.
- If I remember correctly, unlike Google, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that with regard to the application of technology the advanced reality in everyday life the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to keep a smartphone in your hand on the move, but I think that the most tolerant variant would be a "changing" advanced reality, where we could switch over a cloud from the glasses to the smartphone,
The glasses are a personal gadget and there is their strength (private you can only see them), but at the same time their weakness, because an extended reality prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortar.
There is a problem that critics often point to this idea: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures I often speak of the fact that the enlarged reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the tactical perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection documentation.
It exerts great pressure!
However, there are also technologies that are actually geared towards giving the "pictures in the air" a little bit of hand, for example, the interference of some ultrasonic rays creates a feeling that is still so weak at a certain point where the finger is located, as someone pushed over the hand.
There are also ribbons for the wrist that affect the nerves in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to leave the brain?
Let it be thought that it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That is a good idea, so we have not tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will have to contend with for a long time, namely to believe a person who is physically in a closed room, he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with running benches (other than in fitness studios), moving platforms and large spheres.
Until now, the brain can only be superimposed, and we still have many working years.
That is precisely what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive to a researcher: we are only at the beginning on many issues.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru.
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde" dedicated to urban residents who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the exquisite list, high-level representatives of the Petersburger Kunstszene, whose successes go beyond the city’s borders and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known by Kirill Miller, the red-clothed bears, who are sometimes picked up at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at the scene meetings or at Vernissay.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are issued, they attract large numbers of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburger social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburger avant-garde at the end of the 80s or the beginning of the 90s.
He is also a man of the city and, through his presence on the street, enchants his fellow citizens with a smile in the face and makes them feel good.
He recently grabbed a turntable and became the Petersburger Drehorgelspieler, as he finally felt ready to play this difficult role in his artistic performance, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in Rot and not in Gelb or Türkis in the city?
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer dealing with the look and image.
In this world, Rot is the compromise between artists, creators and society.
In society, everything that differs from gravity creates aggression and bad behavior.
However, I want to come into contact with the people through my provocations.
Each of my last provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know that you must become painters?
- At an exhibition in the Kulturpalast Newskij, where my works were exhibited.
I understand that I must go down this path.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters ended at the time, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I would like to thank the painters of the new generation, i.e. the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; it was called "Puschkinskaja 10", and then it was finished.
I draw it to the theatre, to fashion, to music, actually to everything, except the literature.
- And all this united in your art clinic... - It was important to me to be at the heart of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather together.
In 1995 I occupied a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, where there was a musical and artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the Petersburger Boheme, until the renovation work.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to play back, contributed tight trilogy, and one of them was the composer Igor Wdowin, who has been mentioned today.
When the group began to play live, it became her "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg modeled many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but the foundations he learned from us.
The gallery "D 137" or "Griboedov" also originate from the Art-Clinic.
Dorthin went to our staff and regular guests.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000 there was a poll in the press about the award "personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and this was my climax.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Today it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
In the past I was social, but now it is painful and afraid to be so.
In a clown that blurs everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
Let us save the world, for example, by telling us that everyone has to bow completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and focuses on the exterior and not on the inside of the human being.
But perhaps we should not give a man the hand, but let him face.
The deception disappears by the suffering.
- Recently, we saw you in the role of the city's shooter - a cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art also be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, careful and tasteful.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the beans loved the one and the simple people the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a one hundred dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to consider who you will like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- The performances of Stas Michailow come to several thousand!
- To him abandoned women, the sexual-social sphere plays a role there.
For cultural reasons there are 300 people and not 10 thousand, therefore there are fewer management, money, and everything is based on it.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not to destroy the achievements.
In my youth I have painted such pictures, which go on a collector even in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually come only at the end of the career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumption culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and rejected money to paint.
That is the culture that I support.
- Kirill, what is lacking in Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
It is said that servants of culture.
But not everyone can deal with culture.
It was different in the real Czards, because the Czards might not understand much of culture, but they understood that proper experts are needed.
There are good advisers in Moscow at the moment.
In Petersburg, we have those who could be experts, but they will be blocked, as there is a need for more high-level experts who properly assess the former and open the way to them.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore need to look for other museums.
- What is for you Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the Capital of Culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a suitable breeding ground.
It is difficult to grow up on our stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not true.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
That is much less for us.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed from grants from the city of St Petersburg.
Birth in World All
Earth in danger.
Global warming or clash with Killerasteroid.
Karawanese from spaceships with earthly inhabitants on board are looking for a replacement plan.
In order to save humanity, is the important question of how we can reproduce ourselves in gravity or on the replacement plan?
I do not think there are many options.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least inhabit hypothetically.
"Nämlich Mars and Venus", says the scientific assistant of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Wladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at large heights or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in all.
The question of reproduction in all dealt with the researchers first in terms of flora.
Already half a century before, experiments were conducted with plants.
The fourth generation of the inherited in orbit did not differ in any way from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit fly (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, guardians were sent to the world to explore how severity affects the development of embryos.
A normal coke develops.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the cow must stop; it must be able to stand on its legs and begin to move," explained the laboratory manager of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without fixed ground, the cows rushed wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn completely failed.
The cows did not react to light and noises.
Four days later they died simply.
"Two times we let cows slip and put the whole thing in, because it is simply impossible to work with them," says Vladimir Sychew on the failed experiment with the cows in the All.
The last cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, only the same-sex species will be found on the Biosatellites.
There was an experiment with rats that were already sent to the All.
In principle, nothing special has been noted.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was only a single experiment, and the research must continue," says Vladimir Sychew.
After landing, the space councils were given new growth.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals who are taken from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive operation.
In contrast to animals, man could do so in principle.
Homo sapiens are too abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out on ethical considerations.
But women have been flying into all for 50 years.
There was the greatest risk at Tereschkowa.
The most valuable human being is the female organism.
Our Möwe fled about it, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: does it run the space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
"After all, no one answered this question," says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, the first female cosmologist, Valentina Tereschkowa, built a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also Kosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman built a son in the All, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even worked outside the space vehicle.
Nevertheless, there is still a risk.
We have very few monasteries, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy young people.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights to the Orbit", concludes Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakov, the hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet humanity must seek new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravity.
The Hydrolabor in the Preparatory Centre of the Kosmonauten is a compulsory station during the flight preparation.
Here in a sister state, the cosmonauts gain routine for work in open space.
The water is gravity.
Although adults feel that water is pleasant, it is a strange environment, but infants feel that water is a natural element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander bear witness to the fact that life in the country descended from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is approximately 9 months in the stomach of the mother in the fruit water, and that it can then be used more easily to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to first swimming only 2 weeks pass by.
"This is too little time to forget something," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
So, while for a newly born child the severity is a much more natural condition, the woman does not get without gravity.
In the state of gravity, the abdominal and pelvic formation is rapidly declining and thus also the ability to press the child out.
Well, we avoid this by means of pre-booked aid.
The birth could also take place in a special chamber, for example, to press the child out.
"But what happens then?", is the not insignificant question of Waleri Poljakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the attraction of the earth, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newly born child cannot be placed in orbit like an adult for training in a stress suit.
He will simply lack what is fundamental to his life.
"This experiment, which we undertake together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a disabled person, a completely unrelated person to the world," says the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
Until now, the birth of children in the world is mere theory.
At some point, however, it becomes a reality when the Earth's inhabitants descend into a distant planet in their spaceships, which will be the home for their descendants born in All.
NKÚ boss: control of the black system fails due to political fault.
In connection with public contracts, the Czech Republic has good supervisory bodies and adequate laws, but it falls within its application.
In the conversation for Aktuálně.cz, the Vice-President of the High Control Office (Nejvyší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I do not think this is the case with us," comments Kala on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be shared control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he introduces Prime Minister Petr Nečas's attitude to the so-called black system.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the head of the government, and the supervisory office, whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, is in its activities," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Members’ House, you spoke about a common Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared.
What was the specific point?
This is a parallel review that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is a question of the European legislature defining how to handle public contracts, and that is what national legislations are building on, and, finally, there is the actual practical application.
All of this has been compared with each other, and although the test has not yet been completed, we have seen very interesting differences.
This confirms that it is not enough to draw up new and more precise rules on a number of occasions, and we must also look at the actual application of the law.
How can the project be of help to you?
Such joint control could help us to stop constantly striving to improve laws and reduce and reduce threshold values if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economics means purchasing a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
However, the reduction of threshold values for orders does not guarantee that we achieve this objective.
Perhaps it is even the case that, in this way, we only burden the system with excessive 'red tape' and those who seek loopholes in the system have made it much easier to exploit the system than if the threshold values remained higher.
You are talking about the problems of the practical implementation of the Czech awarding law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority like our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart is to the NKÚ of the Federal Banking Bank, which is similar to that of us and also a college, which is only formed slightly differently, but basically both authorities work similarly.
Competence is also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, that is to say that these courts also exist in the individual federal states - the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds administered by us by the municipalities and municipalities are subject to the control of the national courts.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not be able to compare this with any specific information, but in some respects Germany is often called a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in all.
Is this perhaps because the auditors are better there?
That is not certain, but, as I said, I do not like such comparisons particularly.
To this end, it is worth noting that those countries that are a model for us are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, would they not have anything about cooperation with our authority, not?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what is the importance for your authority in amending the awarding law, do you feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this amendment is only a short time in force, it has not yet worked out in our audits.
As our controls take place afterwards, we must expect a certain delay here.
Effects have hitherto been felt more in the preparatory phase of future controls - we have introduced the new control instrument 'detection of risks of inefficiency' and examined and analysed with this almost 14,000 public contracts - these changes will of course have an effect, as the threshold values change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you consider the adoption of this law to be more positive, or will the system be burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this adoption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules are 'stricter' and cannot be observed.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subjected to examination are accountable to the carrier (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) to ensure that any non-compliance with the awarding act is tantamount to a breach of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense, however, to make the law even stricter?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system is only putting red tape under even greater pressure.
Where is the way out?
First of all, let us say what path is not targeted.
The Prime Minister recently said that ODS would not fix entrepreneurs with controls on the so-called 'black system' - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now banned or allowed?
A law must be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, then it is not easy for the President of the government to interfere with the supervisory office, whose duty is to control compliance with the law.
He can say: 'We change the law and allow the cause', but he cannot say that we do as if nothing were.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and that is also true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic if the Bidder with the best offer is excluded solely on the basis of formalities.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think we lack.
On the streets there is some ice cream, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there are some snow and ice glasses.
However, the roads are well accessible, and sometimes there is a need for increased caution.
Karlsbad
In the district of Karlovy Vary, the streets were easily accessible this morning, some of which were snow and ice-cream.
The temperature decreased to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should become somewhat warmer.
In the region, it is no longer fast, and in the deeper heights, only a thin snowfall remains.
But on the mountains there are about 30 cm of snow.
According to the city's history, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 motorway and the first-class roads in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention must be paid, for example, to bridges where the trams are sometimes worn and smooth.
It is also possible to take all the second and third-class transport routes, including the highways.
On these roads, however, there are some parts of the snow list or the snow list.
More attention is therefore needed, especially in the higher layers.
district Pardubice and Hradec Králové
There is a risk on some roads in eastern Bohemia due to ice glazing, in higher places and in the mountains there is still a snow cover on the roads, sharing the road and motorway directorate on their web pages.
The street championships warn drivers of ice glazing, which can occur especially in higher locations in the Pardubice district.
Ice glasses can be reached in particular on the roads of the second and third class in the circles of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemical.
Snow is located on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the mountains of Orlické hory.
A snowy slope is located in heights on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
Today, it is mostly sunny or hot in eastern Bohemia, and it remains largely muddy-free.
The temperature is between -3 and +1 °C, a weak wind blows.
Pilsen district
The roads in the Pilsen district are now well accessible, but local attention is given, and the way is adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it has been snowed beforehand and the temperatures then dropped, it may be possible to come to ice-cream on the roads.
There is also a fog to be expected, but the visibility will improve in the course of the day.
This information is provided by the regional road championships.
The D5 motorway is practically unlimited, but increased attention is recommended by the road championships between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The first-class trams are mostly dry but frozen.
In the south of the Pilsen and Tachov counties, however, it can be reached to ice glasses.
The second and third class trams are humid, and therefore the reference to possible narrowness is also valid here.
Drivers should be particularly careful on less frequented roads in the area of the Bohemian Forest.
district Olomouc
Today, snow-capped drivers are expected to move in the direction of the heights in the Olomouc district.
After the use of stretch vehicles snow remains on the pass Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
The road championships had to be used for further cutting purposes, according to the indications of the road administration, about 3 cm Neuschnee fell in the Šumperk district.
In the other areas of the district, the highways are mostly fully accessible.
"In the circle of Šumperk, snow remains in the heights.
On the Červenohorské sedlo pass, the riders in the direction of Jeseník will have to reckon with a snapshot", said a member of the Šumperk street administration to the ČTK agency today.
Her colleagues in Jeseník county also had to go out overnight, according to her data, the roads are free and wet to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc county, the roads are fully accessible, but in the Šternberk county, the drivers must be careful in woods, as the highways are still humid.
District Ústí nad Labem, district Liberec
In northern Bohemia, the street championships report several ill-traffic sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice glacier, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the Ústí n.K. is closed according to the traffic police.
The temperature is also lower than zero, so that snow and ice are kept on the streets, but the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Mountains, are not reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
Up to now no traffic disturbances have been reported.
Eisglätte is reported in particular from the Štětí area.
According to Meteorologen, there were ideal conditions for this during the night - rain and melting snow, in the night cloudy skies and frost.
From the main roads as well as from the I/13 road on the border of the districts Ústí n.L. and Liberec, bad traffic conditions are reported.
The locking of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to branches pushed from the snow elast to the drive.
Šimon Ornest: On our concerts we want to collect positive energy.
What do you think about the fact that the end of the world will take place in less than a month?
This is one of the disasters that we people are so keen to address.
With our band The Tap Tap we are more funny and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world's collapse.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world stage.
Can you imagine the project to our readers?
It is a country-wide charity event that we have been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, the end of which is forecast for December 21st at 11:10 in the morning.
On the day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will take place from 21:00 at the same time in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts should be about the time to end the Mayan calendar on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which lies in a time zone 12 hours before us.
Who did this idea come from?
Originally from me, then we have developed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
In doing so, we do not just want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the world's collapse, but we would also like to think, together with the public, about the state in which we pass this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and key trailers against the world stage, with their purchase via www.e-tap.cz the people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers, has also recorded the so-called anthem against the world stage with the title "Weltuntergang fällt aus".
Today, the anthem on YouTube is very popular, and will it be on the Benefia concerts?
Of course, and at the end of the day, provided that everything goes wrong and the world's end does not happen...
The anthem is to be sung simultaneously by all the interpreters on all three concerts.
In addition, the anthems are transmitted live in a direct circuit from Czech television.
The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you work with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many charities and concerts...
We try to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us and have fun.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational centre Studeo, on which we already work six years together with the association Tap in the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly assisted by lecturers who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to find the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
Within the framework of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building is to be created, in which we then move with this project.
In each concert several groups and interpreters perform.
Which criteria did you select them?
We wanted to set up a programme that addresses all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý appear.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "major events" planned for the future?
For the first time in May we will be at the Prague Spring and for this concert we will prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to appear in the Czech house in New York, and I personally - if we are in the USA - would like to combine this with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organisationally?
It is not as bad as it appears at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage room, and we must, of course, put together many instruments and other luggage.
Nevertheless, it has always been without problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes wondered some of them.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
By travelling abroad, you have a comparison of what is happening in individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you seen these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than ours, we in Russia were witnessing that everything in the East is still in its beginnings.
Moscow is not a disability-free city, but it is still unusual for people travelling in wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even self-evident that a wheelchair driver, for example, is allowed in the lift.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way must we catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things in which we are lagging behind...
In addition, however, it is worth noting that improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely customary that people with severe disabilities also move independently in public areas, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not customary for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in social events there, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years, what did you motivate to create a band in 1998?
At that time, I began as a maintainer in the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in working with a little bit more intensively.
And since I am a musician myself and play Saxofon, I have founded a music-AG together with a colleague.
Na, and with the time, as our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, will have to say something out of control (laughs).
But was the band known only in the last years, or do I wrong?
It is true that our cooperation with well-known singers has helped us; we have also started to actively promote us.
We have become aware that if you do something and do not see it outside, your own performance does not exist in a sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also afford good doctorates, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the outset, I have felt the potential to approach things differently.
In the showbusiness today one often copies one of the other.
This is logical in its way, since everything is considered with caution and only accepted after a long time.
There are few really unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression the viewer usually has is of course pity; that is only natural...
But this pity is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned, and we must regret it.
They are people who can live and develop a full life, provided they have the means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not just a step forward for them, but a step forward for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you cannot compromise on many things, and you must also demand some discipline.
However, I think this is quite normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have twice the week rehearsals, have to go through preparatory periods and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm for many quickly disappears.
So it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people come and go, and we cannot prevent that.
Whoever has the will and the desire to join us is always welcome.
On the day before the projected world end, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m. 
Events are: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians.
All three venues are connected at the end by a live circuit and a common interpretation of the anthem "Weltuntergang fällt aus" of the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to find the means to equip a multi-functional, handicapped educational centre that will be created under the name STUDEO in the Jedlička Institute in Prague.
The admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a ministerial meeting of the member states of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted to be the twentieth member of this space agency, the second member of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which was a member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began a close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
But Poland’s road to space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmopolitans worked with space space, not always understanding it.
I would like to remind you, for example, of the lecture of A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented ideas from his pioneering work "Innsbruck to Kosmonautik".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch awarded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important champion of astronomy and space space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's worldwide recognized contribution to the development of space was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the ground side of the moon was named after him.
In 1925, a railway Draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project unfortunately remained unknown.
It has not even been clarified whether the rockets should be used to start or to brake the Draisine.
The information on this is exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with abstract guns.
The research conducted by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyegicki.
From the documents that have been delivered, it is apparent that research had been carried out until the stage of practical tests.
However, research was interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, in the press of the design of a photoelectric hunting rocket originating from Ing. Rohoziński, the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared in the following year.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the missile drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work its work was stopped from the start of the war.
Further articles on space appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this company was made in 1954 in the November edition of the magazine Problemy, in which four major articles of space are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space company.
At the time, the first satellite technology projects were already in place, and it was clear that research into space would have a future.
As early as 1956, the Polish space company PTA sought to join the 1951 International Space Federation, and indeed the PTA became a regular member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He held this post until his death in 1959.
Since 1956 PTA has been instrumental in developing the highly successful meteorological rockets (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start was made on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not exceed 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 the Błędów desert began flying tests with the two-tier RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and approximately 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for monitoring height winds.
In 1962, however, further development was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket was developed in 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as two-step rockets, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket have been developed (Meteor-1A, 1B and -1C), which differ from one another in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B with 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The maximum height of the flight was 37 km in all three types.
In 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed in the aerospace institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of approximately 60 km.
Then the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 was also worth mentioning, and two years later the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites under the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second Intercosmonaut after the Czechs Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the law on non-profit works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court suspended the law on non-profit work.
This decision provoked a lively debate in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that individual economies are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages) there is a price increase.
This concept is to understand a state in which the manufacturer tries to compete with the economy by importing low-cost goods by "undercutting" the competition in order to gain a greater market share in itself and to increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to relocate their production abroad or to buy it cheaply, or to give up their business, resulting in high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, government spending is bound to increase.
This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus to compensate for the overall social and social damage they cause.
This situation is well known so that concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital creates a situation in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments deliver private capital without regard to the social consequences.
This is particularly reflected in changes in existing legislation.
The aim of these measures is to force its own people to accept the dictation of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This is done firstly by economic constraints on long-term unemployment and, secondly, by cutting workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, there have been public food tax authorities for the poor for several years, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already millions.
As the German economy becomes more competitive, there are regular cases in which workers receive such low wages that the state must increase its income to the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal was also uncovered in the case of aid workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of practically all the EU’s southern states will doubtless go to the same state of affairs, in which people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century) under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in their social level, or to live up to a starvation on the fringes of society, hoping that private investment capital will eventually flow into the country.
The question of where this capital comes from is, of course, urgent.
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt, or Africa, workers are working for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim that the state must not be involved with capital in its own economy, and that the planned economy leads to the economic disaster.
Private capital insists very much on its position that the state should not be allowed to intervene decisively in the economy.
Then we have to ask ourselves whether private capital does not affect or even govern politics and therefore the entire state in its own selfish sense.
The clear answer here is yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically omnipotent lobby that is omnipresent in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual awarding, legislation in which practically everything is negligible but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is that a Ministry of State is charged with drafting laws on private, closely linked legal entities with industry.
These draft laws are then adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence no longer goes out of the cloud, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies are rapidly getting into a situation as they described Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Cäsars and Pompeius: "The state has long been disintegrating, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
Opposite Schmiergeld, through unlawful lightening of advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption had no obstruction, and the people went to the election with previously bought votes... "people with character did not protect themselves for offices, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "one really started to speak that the only medicine in this serious situation was an exclusive rule, and that a strong man had to be elected"... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was then Cäsar, who permanently replaced democracy by the sole authority.
As it turns out, today's society, as in the ancient world, is based on the reckless preference of its own benefit, without respecting the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is not in a position to recognize and enforce the benefits for society as a whole.
The result, today as it was, is an unprecedented decapitation of elites, who do not seek deeper reforms in the slightest sense.
The cause of the emergence of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalisation of the economies of the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today’s point of view, the demise of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a pause in which the next round is already looming.
Particularly catastrophic is the fact that today's elites face the loss in the future of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity, as we know from older and recent history.
The repeal of the law on non-profit works is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms, which increase the state’s share of capital in the economy, increase citizens’ influence on the government, and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Labor of Chaos.
"... that nothing comes from violence or could ever arise" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose main verse in the Refrain is: "...so that we don't forget how fragile we are.
"If my sons did not want wars, there would be no," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, there was, as always, a myriad of reactions.
Some are behind Israel, arguing with its right to self-defence while they call the Palestinians terrorists; the others are supporting the Palestinians, arguing with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs, and calling the State of Israel a terrorist.
At this point, I do not want to write about who is the culprit and who is the victim in these recurring waves of killing; in the end, the present inhabitants of Israel, including the areas of self-management, were born into the current political situation and did not see the start of the violence themselves.
It is a question of giving readers a look behind the scenes, looking at who the 95 years of tension (expected from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) in the small spot country in the Middle East are particularly useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them, and come from my own understanding of who, or which group of people, has a decisive influence on the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less apparent is the question of whether it really was these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or whether behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that emerges from it has not arisen within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families there is a particularly strong one that could be described as the head of the crank (I don't know if there is one over them, but I don't finish this) - the red shirts.
Much is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds in the nineties of the 19th century to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which the consolidation of their power, the increase in their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the world’s central banks, and against the countries in which they are not involved in central banks, they are waging wars or equipping themselves with them (before the invasion of Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq, there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafi, only four remaining, with Russia in the meantime being subordinated to its central bank to the Russian Government).
Whoever tried to confront this family had to pay for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild’s Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue his own (i.e. state) banknotes during the civil war, and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; the MEP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for triggering the Great Depression in 1929.
In 1859 - 1871, the Rothschild's global power supply led to the formulation of a plan to demolish three world wars by Albert Pik, a wall of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of recognition.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist nations of Europe, the second war was to break Britain's colonial rule in particular, and the third war was to reduce the world's population to around 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide their amenities and luxury, and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenicism is nothing more than the pre-eminence) and, finally, the assumption of absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao - order out of chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see creation of the FED, so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After the murder of the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they succeeded in triggering the First World War, they destroyed the Russian empire through the Bolsheviks revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military, and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian empire the war was no longer necessary), followed by the dissolution of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to make the Second World War easier to escape, policymakers allowed bankers to create a latent conflict situation by putting Germany under gigantic war repairs; by doing so, they created the condition of impoverished masses, so that they only had to bow to the Germans a sufficiently strong leader who called the culprits and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to take over the function of a fifth column and also took in order to unleash the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild initiated the creation of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical area of Judaea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration, which has already been mentioned, created the precondition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; first clashes with the Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and if Hitler did not escape from the chain at which the international bankers had initially held him, or if everything was planned, it is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the precondition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and, as was prepared for the Second World War by the war repairs against Germany, the proclamation of the State of Israel is the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people, like the Second World War, will be the victim of the front line of war, this time with the Arab and Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge lab, a source of contention and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (remember only how sharply the people share in followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice only causes injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power at the beginning?
It is important to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders here, because international bankers in Israel, as well as ourselves, the people, are putting their own candidates to the polls.
Israel’s current prime minister, Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist-prone, loyal international bankers, who is doing all they can to spark a war with Iran, which, given Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly expand into a global conflict, with Iran’s control over the only 2-mile long horism road, which runs more than 20% of world oil supplies, destroying the global economy.
In what light appears in the words of David Rockefeller from 1994: 'The only thing we need is an all-round crisis, and people will welcome the new world order'.
In their imagination, the new world order is a world of men and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn child is implanted at birth to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes that the little and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a sign to their right hand or to their foreheads that nobody can buy or sell, he have the sign of painting, namely the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom, who has mind, who thinks of the number of animals.
Because it is a human figure, and its number is sixteen and sixteen.'
The movie Argo: When's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist students seized the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they called for the extradition of the shaky Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the US after the revolution, which had protected the patronage of his regime for decades.
There was no positive way out of this situation for the American Government - it could not afford to throw over the shame, as this would have severely damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the creation of a theocratic regime.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the united states, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to release hostages made everything worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated by the Algerian Government.
The fate of hostages provoked a wave of solidarity at home and anti-Iranian sentiment.
Iran’s debacle contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo of the director and actress Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the US a small partial victory.
Immediately before the embassy was filled, six embassy workers escaped.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring refugees from Iran, helping them an extravagant story to cover their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports as members of a film station that allegedly visited the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of Genres
The plan developed by the expert on "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required the collaboration of Hollywoods.
In order for the purification to be credible, articles on this film project appeared in magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time, based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic politthriller, but also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful Husarenstück such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood levels in the film - on the one hand, the documentaries from Teheran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no great differences in the film version of the same situations).
On the other hand, the relaxed passages from Hollywood, which are therefore ironically and slightly exaggerated.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the offices, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has achieved a remarkable restart of his career with this film.
From a smile actor has become a respectable director, and as an actor he is no longer the object of ironic comments.
Argo is his third film after the crime No Children's Game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and Thriller City without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film, which does not play in the native Boston of the director.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics of the previous films of this director from the Standard Hollywoods.
However, Affleck proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the input of the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet conveying the sense of confusion and predictability that happens when history moves somewhere.
Affleck has a similar effect with his team even in fictitious scenes (the wrong film table on a baseball in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that history does not offer many exciting scenes in the filmic sense.
However, he is working very successfully with the few, sometimes helping the reality - which does not always work so elegantly (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted from a phone in America, or the persecution on the run-off track, have a knock-on effect).
The weakness of Argo is its too broad dispersion due to the need to show too much in action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures deserve more space, and they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck'
However, enthusiasm makes him difficult.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that has so far been alive in a way, and as proof of how exaggerated the ideas of the omnipotent and knowledgeable secret services are, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for blowing air balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually publishes a survey of the most absurd bank charges, decided this year to organise the contest "the most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This idea brought us the EU's recent plan to introduce a 40% female quota in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who cares about organizing this survey, to the Právo newspaper.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, is the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance tariffs for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they pose an objective lower risk to insurance companies.
"Other incredible launches from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place by the end of February 2013', informed contributors.
Among the EU's controversial regulations is the mandatory addition of bioethanol to fuels, which is natural, and the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has made eggs much more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism has also been levelled at the de facto ban on the use of the term 'butterage' or the ban on the sale of conventional bulbs.
Banana must be 14 cm long.
The EU apparatus often decides under pressure from this or that trade and industry lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually represented by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to impose the demands of Czech banks with a veto threat).
Lobby interests also consisted of the fact that bananas must be at least 14 cm long in the EU's highest trade class, and that they must not have 'cruising flavour'.
The European Commission defended the argument that it would only harmonise the inconsistent national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards relating to fruit and vegetables have already been raised by the EU against the resistance of some countries to the point that the previous directives would result in a waste of food.
A candidate for victory in this poll may be the EU regulation of last year, which, in accordance with air balloons, must be indicated that children under eight years of age should not be allowed to inflate the air balloon without supervision of an adult.
The EU drew attention to an American study, which, according to air balloons, is the leading cause of the death of children.
A similar restriction applies to children up to 14 years of age when using vintage turtles.
Curios are also available at home.
It is also a relatively absurd directive which concerns European officials themselves - anyone who has an official role in the EU must not use the term Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, besides the absurdities, the EU regulation on the scope of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks in the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then, for example, crossed the fixed volume of fungal canyons, for which we had a great deal of money.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving funding to applications for funding.
But these ideas were not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will apply for a refund to the EU," stated in autumn 2004 by the then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that cereal harvests were very high and that the state camp was overcrowded as a result of so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, according to Palas, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us.
Finally, the European Commission came to the Czech Republic to organise a tender on the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Aid funds for applications for funding were provided to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development under the guidance of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically, it should be funds for the establishment of funding applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre Regulations are the exception.
In the Member States, regulations are easily becoming the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and, therefore, the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union, but some experts believe that they deserve more recognition.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which have been forced into the budgetary negotiations by individual Member States.
Emotions are also prompted by the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, must fight for the right to use specific designations of traditional products and not always win this battle.
The Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition goes back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename "Tuzemák".
Rum may only be used for products from sugar cane breastfeeding, not for sugar beet products.
The official list of products registered in the EU now includes the Karlovy Vary Zwieback, Karpfen from Pohořelice and Třeboň, and the Saazer Hopfen.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer Lebkuchen or the Hořicer rolls can boast.
"The people want me to rescue the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," said Okamura.
Mr Senator, what is the idea of standing for the presidency?
I do not want to be a senator or president.
If everything would work without problems in our country, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been plundered for 20 years, how thieves run freely, while people are increased taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But if I see something I do not like, I try to propose a solution to change that.
And since I am more than 40, and independent and partisan, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate you have managed to get to the castle right away.
Do you not turn your constituents back?
I have told me all the time that I will take up the battle for the castle after the result of the Senatswahlen.
Later I clarified this and said that I am going to run for the office of President, provided I am elected senator.
My goal is not the function, but the function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and as strong a mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as the people of the Kneipe and in front of the television, are stirring up everyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media, who want to rob you of the honour, and who confuse the freedom of the word with freedom.
About me, for example, it was claimed that I would be a journalist or that I was a consultant of Jiří Paroubek.
Let us talk about your visions.
With the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retrospective declarations of wealth, you have taken over 20 million crowns.
To do this, you must change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can table legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have worked to ensure that the travel guide remains a free trade, and this has been achieved.
The problem is the petty policy - if someone from the right or from the left comes with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only holds the population up.
As an independent party loser, I have a much greater potential to gain support for all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take from any party without drawbacks and party dogmas what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a man in politics more right or left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me more left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
For me, it is important that we move forward.
It is not a question of whether someone belongs to the left or to the right; I want to link people.
In any case, I publicly support any good solution, even if it comes from KSČM or ODS, and I will also oppose bad ideas.
It is wrong for someone to call you a populist.
But do you not confirm what you have just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that is what you want to get closer to.
This may be called populism, but all the proposals I have spoken about already work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But, without support in Parliament, you will only remain keywords.
And that does not make you go far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you only talk long enough with people, you will be able to enforce, for example, material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to put them on our side to achieve these goals.
As President, it would be no problem for me to call on the chairmen of the parliamentary parties on television live to enshrine the material and criminal liability of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors in law.
And the people should then perhaps say why they reject this.
A strong personality that points to maladministration can exert pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the President, who was a credit for public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and try to support the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things themselves; and if it does not work, then I go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a retroter.
I know that I have achieved nothing alone, so I have spoken to several well-known personalities about whether they do not want to run for the Senate.
I have, for example, talked to Radim Jančura, who refused to do so because of disability.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the fraud in the trade in light domestic tariffs.
My candidacy began with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty per cent of the electorate did not go to the elections at all, and those who have gone have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
People have chosen such a sensation interpretation that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of the mayors and district leaders.
Do you think about setting up your own party?
I have not yet thought about this, because I do not have time to review the past of any potential party member, nor do I have the money to do so.
I do not even have money for the presidential campaign; my transparent account is only 20,000 CZK.
You have no money?
You talk about asset statements, how do you think?
I value my private assets to around 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a property worth 25 million, a flat for about 10 million, another for 8 million, a collection of art worth about 10 million, and a Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu superb worth about a million, and then I have a few million on the account.
The Aston Martin was also a children's dream - James Bond always liked me as he did in the car, galant to women, and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but your own money does not want to invest in it.
That is not convincing.
I do not have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I, for example, make debt?
I have already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I do not have sponsors shows that my programme does not arouse too much interest.
And I am not obliged to dispute the campaign out of my own resources.
The costs of the campaign are basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live from the senatological content alone; for example, I could not finance my son the English school, which costs 30,000 per month.
If I only wanted to make money, I would not run for anything.
Do you, then, remain active as an entrepreneur to have your return?
Do you not say that you will return to these activities?
But this is not related to the level of salary.
As promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy in the spring will become Managing Director of the travel agency.
The people want to see me as Samaritans who save the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
Which monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
As President, however, I would like to make a total stop to my business.
You can find the full conversation in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventure is not only in the head - in the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos.
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again", says Lisette Verhaig, a passer on the street edge.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large business, says: "But, beautiful is it, the house."
But I wonder what we need to do today with a book book.
All have Internet, iPad and E-Books.
Nowadays, no man is still voluntarily going to one of these old style libraries, or?
Spijkenisse, a small town in front of the gates of Rotterdams, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000 population community has the lowest rate of education in the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid situation, a few years ago, we decided to contribute to general education and to rebuild the seven fictitious bridges on the euro notes as pretty pink concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to get rid of the statistic: a library had to come!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam Architecture Office MVRDV, Master of the tollby-shaped balancing collection and producer of funny, or even often cynical buildings, took the matter with the usual serenity and appeared to the competition-Hearing anno 2003 with five books supporting arms and a smile in the face.
And while the jury was still wearing around and suggesting with the axes, the freshness Maas stacked his exquisite companions of size after a pyramid and ended his activist-backed speech with the words: "Love city community!"
So it is my proposal for Spijkenisse's bookshop, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro-expensive mountain is burnt.
It is part of a revitalisation project, including underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent apartments and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the senseless small town towns, which until now had no more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a pointless ugly town hall behind which white facades would be inclined to imagine a dairy factory to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural construction in the history of its existence.
The Long Path to the Book
The first impression: Book Book Book Book Book under Chess.
There is a lift that leads through the mountain massif, but the real delights of the room and reading can be found in the noise of the topography.
The glazed interior is bright and clear, the roasted Klinkerboden and the elegant street lamps clearly speak the language of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You already have a look at Parkbank, Hund and Football Players and Mädels.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, the bookshops are along the façade, and in the middle is a large dark room, which is mostly unrecognizable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have placed the classic room configuration on the head and pushed the reading area from outside.
The inside of the book book book book book book book is cleverly used: in the middle there are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and house technology centre.
A special delight is the black bookshops, which are sometimes wall dressing, sometimes armour, sometimes forehead areas.
Optics, haptics and smell are foreign.
Even crowded architects and construction engineers shake the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here", explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipal district of Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And that is the way in which we came to a suitable waste from agriculture one day in a rural farm.
For many years, the Netherlands has been using a millimetre thin plastic fleece in greenhouses and in fields.
That is cheap and timely.
The thin textile holds one or two seasons, after which it is ripe for the lock bag.
For the library, the Vlies - for the first time in these quantities - were pressed to four centimetres thick plates.
Under heat effect and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, burdened material that smells a bit of new cars and a bit of sports shoes.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500 metre long hike you will be rewarded in the Literaturcafé not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch crowds and top-notch Ficusbäumen.
They provide an atmosphere, but above all they ensure the correct humidity in the liturgy.
Donations for the New Soul
"You would not believe it, but this house is, despite the many glass surfaces, a flagship project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled with earth heating.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass dome, the sun itself appears only briefly inside on sunny days.
The broad wooden cupboards, which are located across the glass facade, serve as a relief and absorb most of the sunlight.
The room was very comfortable.
The rest perform fully automatic rolls.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptics from the IT industry, already dared to move into the new library.
Lisette was also there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who calls the Boekenberg a "long overdue soul" as Spijkenisses.
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, every inhabitant was invited to donate a book from his own personal stock.
For the time being, the optical gaps are to be filled in the not yet fully equipped library - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has been tackled.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a semi-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, now every inhabitant has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only to the Zierde.
In this way, MVRDV has achieved the royal discipline that is called the Identity Foundation in the jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote literary history.
It may be as young and unborn.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Deutsche must play a greater role."
Germany abstained from the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in US relations, Berlin is thus balancing at a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany initially signaled that it would vote against the request for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
At the same time, however, I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the Libyan uprising in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on setting up a no-fly zone.
This was eventually imposed by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that is true.
This is because it is changing its foreign policy, away from a policy that was, so to speak, managed by the US, to a German foreign policy.
What is more, Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans therefore find themselves among the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe they are still playing their part, but they are on the way to a more 'normal' foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as France or the United Kingdom.
What does a 'normal' foreign policy mean specifically from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests, which are independent of those of the USA or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other big powers, and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Did these economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
It must therefore be careful not to upset the public, but also the elites, in Arab countries.
In any case, this is important.
But I would not want to attach too much weight to this, which is not a completely unilateral relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the US by abstaining on important decisions, such as the Palestine vote?
I believe that there is great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the United States.
Therefore, I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will actually show some respect.
Because it signals that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that his interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The US, on the other hand, has clearly declared itself in favour of a veto.
Are there differences between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, the government cannot publicly represent this position.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so bright about Netanyahu’s policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on one hand, and the position of the EU's main partners on the other?
I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they cannot be part of a broader line and must instead drive things out of their own position.
That is what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
That has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans understand that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player - does Germany want to play a leading role at all?
Or is Germany still struggling to lead?
Germany has not yet become accustomed to it, which is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
If, for example, we look at the euro crisis, there are different anti-German feelings every time Germany plays a greater role.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
That is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be receptive to various neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now, the US’s influence in European politics is steadily diminishing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who is left there?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and it makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"brand protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese suddenly.
Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a very officially registered name in China, but it has nothing to do with the origin companies.
However, it has been protected for as long as the actual names do not complain.
And even then it is not clear whether they are right.
"It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer in Taylor Wessing, who specializes in infringements of intellectual property rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The imitators already have a few additional letters so that they can register their brands.
This makes Gucci just Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you can enter Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company was able to protect the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
Pattloch’s cases, however, are different: on behalf of his clients, he prevents Chinese companies from being officially granted the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a bypass trademark.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who are rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any blame.
"This is difficult, you have to fight it," calls Pattloch.
"The brand is watered down, the singing disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the procedural costs of the sectors affected go to the millions, especially for expensive premium products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China, with a volume of €15 billion a year, is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
But deleting dubious entries in the brand register is difficult to achieve and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can move, with uncertain results.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court waived proceedings because after the long term of the complained name became "market reality".
If the plaintiff has bad luck, he must pay the plagiator even money because he violated his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle reigns here.
Particular cases also affect graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a litigation with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese may therefore still use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that recalled BMW; the dispute was revealed, Geely had to change it.
The fashion producer Lacoste lost in China against counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore who took the famous crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any blame.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admitted that there were bottlenecks in 2010 due to too small personnel and space supplies.
Last year, however, we have returned from the 'emergency situation in the workflow to normality'.
Thus, the intake of unsolicited opposition procedures has fallen by 22%.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Yet 81,500 appeals are still awaiting completion in office.
Action against this costs a lot of money.
As so often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO introduced more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010.
That is a record and it means that China, for the tenth time in succession, is leading the list of newcomers around the world, shares the authority.
This also applies to the stock of all current trade marks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan had been charged.
Simplified means that each registration costs 1280 yuan or 160 Euro.
To tackle this problem costs a lot, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the Group has been fighting a Chinese plagiator.
The Germans were able to ensure that their illegal factory of imitated motor vehicles was lifted.
But counterfeiters continued to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
It was not possible to protect family names in Germany, as Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich, said.
The trademark office CTMO rejected the objection of Munich.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the opponent continues to fight.
You have to be careful to be careful.
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the dishes.
But he also says: 'The procedure is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves'.
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company archive has even had to look through 100 years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite side a "high six-digit euro amount" to settle.
"We see how much we value that," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to sink back to Europe.
In other words, if Imitators are there to secure unprotected brands.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long since abandoned this business, yet it has been unable to register.
"You must be careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international brand rights, but foreigners should "register everything that is somehow worth protecting, including in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was in the last act of his brand drama, one would probably have to pay the opposite license fees for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we are pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Aid Day: Stamps, sing, help, help.
In Heidelberg the choir Imbongi - and in Swasiland AIDS seekers are looking forward to this.
The history of a connection that transcends far more than 8733 kilometres.
First there is the Stamps: Cowboystiefel, basketball shoes, ladies pumps and Herrenslipper search on the parquet floor, find it fast.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly float - old, bass, tenor and soprano - annoying, listening and listening.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, lifts it almost out of his gloves when he brings it together with his smooth, wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi probes a new song.
The fifty singers have come to the age of 23 to 69, from the human genetics to the Hausmann.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choral voice has a different text and it is also spoken in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swasiland.
Aid to Self-help
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, which is estimated to be the United Nations programme for Aids.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
In Swasiland there are 245000 Aidswaisen.
More than 40% of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 Aidswaisen in the village of Esitjeni, the Verein Voices for Africa Paten found in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can take a sponsorship.
It guarantees school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means on Zulu storytellers or even praises.
The Bantusprache fluent can speak in this room no one, but singing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been singing songs in this foreign soft language and brings them back and back to where they originally come from: in the south of Africa.
For 8 733 kilometres of air line from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swasiland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voice of the German chorus.
Forty per cent are infected.
About 2,000 people live there, some still live in simple mud and straw huts, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they are forced into the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, the whole Swasiland suffers from this: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to the Unicef.
Cutting the male foreskin, which demonstrably reduces the risk of contagion by half, is hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty per cent of people in Swasiland bear the immune virus in itself, to die with the middle of thirty is not a rarity.
In a joint Africa trip in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all Imbongis saw many children on the streets, not only due to parental care, but simply to everything: food, clothing, education.
Without leaving school, there is no chance in a poor country.
At the beginning it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association, which since then has been almost professionally responsible for the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI includes syphilis, chlolamydia and tripper (Gonorrhö).
Often viral STI are HIV, Human Pappilomavires, Herpes genitalis or Hepatitis.
Filzläuse und Krätze belong to the parasitary STI.
Who are the main groups of people?
Syphilis and Tripper are especially important for men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
For heterosexual adults, Chlamydia infections, Trichomonades, Candidose (Pilz), Tripper and Humane Pappilomavires are often sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults here is comparatively low - nevertheless: around 20% of HIV news infections account for this group.
Chlamydia infections are more frequent among young people than in other communities.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, human poplar viruses often occur in young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of Syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 illnesses to 3698 in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has declined since 2007.
There were around 2700 cases in 2011.
This is about a tenth less than in the year before.
What are the symptoms of gender disease?
The infectious diseases can cause dizziness in the genital area, urine complaints, excursions, dropping pain and leaves or hot.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unaffected.
How can we protect ourselves?
condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but do not offer 100% protection.
For in some cases, infectious sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubricant infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of often changing sex partners.
Early diagnostics can cure most STI and avoid late follow.
A lot of things come together by sponsorship, donation and, last but not least, the gages that the choir takes over throughout Germany.
"All in all, we have already sent around EUR 200 000 to Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans get well under, for example in one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, called the old women on Zulu, are the bases of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children appear in their uniforms every day on time to school.
Those who no longer have anyone come to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club just like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a sewage school, built two chickens and organized with the American Health Organization PSI that many in the village have made an HIV test.
This is not self-evident, as the disease is obviously the disease throughout the country, and it is the one who loves to silence it.
A King with 14 wives
'Aids is an absolute taboo', says Annette Lennartz, 'because it has to do with sexuality'.
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
It is also due to this state-sanctioned way of life that the HI virus has spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms would exist at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Culture is another - flesh to flesh'.
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels all two or three years together through the South of Africa and sings songs full of nostalgia, combat spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many know at the southern tip of the black continent from times of apartheid.
A bus full of white who sing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has also trodden some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The journey takes you to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their children.
Even if you hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light" tell the people there.
And if you return the 8733 kilometres of air line to Heidelberg, to the stamped singers in the rehearsal at the Bergheimer Straße, you can see it there too.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on the Merkur!
The Sonde Messenger found evidence that there is ice on the planet Merkur.
The ice cap may be up to 20 metres thick.
The US Space Agency (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Merkur.
Although he is closest to the sun, there are frozen water there as well as three studies published on Thursday in the magazine "Science".
The Son Messenger found evidence that there is an ice cap in the permanently shadows of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimetres and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comrades or possibly asteroids that are on the edge.
No one brings the Fund of Ice but related to the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger-Sonde, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the base can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The sparks, however, could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Surrounded by the Earth's citizens, there are probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix to explore the depths of the world.
From time to time they send pictures to the earth: Little rubber holes in infinite expanses.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who circles behind Neptun around the Sun, Ceres is not a "planet" after the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This image section of an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless stars: the oldest stars are to be seen as blue points, harder to identify are the pink "newborns" in the starry room.
The telescope Spitzer discovered in the star image of Cassiopeia, a distance of 6500 light years.
This shiny glitter of a dying star has received the nickel telescope of the Nasa.
The Donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star triggers in the dying process.
In the huge Trifid fog, 5400 light years away from the earth, gas and dust are creating new stars.
The Spitzer telescope of the Nasa shot this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The Plejaden star clusters, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the mere eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better applied.
Like a red age, the helix fog looks at this infrared photo to the viewer.
It is located 700 light years away from the Aquarius star.
His similarity with an earthly continent led this fog to North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo provides spectacular colouring.
This babysitter was only able to be received in his full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and his rings: How they were created is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a saturn moon, which disappeared without trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and strongest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The Jacuzzi Galaxy
Depending on the colour, images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
The recording published by the European South ternwart shows the trifid fog in the star image Schütze, which is several thousand light years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (divided three, divided three), as dark dust threads divide the bright heart of the starry birthplace.
Astronomers have photographed the harbins of a cosmic carmbosis in the constellation of snails: 400 million light years away from Earth, the core of two merged galaxies is razed together and are inevitably clashing with each other.
This star birth marked the Hubble telescope in the Spiral Galaxy M83.
Those who do not have technical abbreviations may call them in their nickname Südliches Feuerrad.
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a cut from the Irisnebel in the star picture Kepheus.
The 1400 light year-away fog consists of dust baskets, which are ten to a hundred times smaller than normal house dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, began the space telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy called scientists UGC 1810.
In this star bell is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The star weighing always produces new Youngster.
This stars cloud, connected with the rose fog, is also creating new nurses - 5000 light years away from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was only shortly after the Big Bang when hydrogen was found in the universe.
Our insights into all: The most important telescopes
The telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, even before Galileo Galilei began to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescope have become ever greater - and the insights they provide have become deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale-Teleskop in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest remote pipe.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
There are two mirrors in sight, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone is 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 metres.
The disadvantage of the low-cost construction: the telescope is stuck in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
Its special feature: the high light velocity.
In fact, despite comparatively low mirror diameters, this is sufficient to the world's largest mirror telescope.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are hearing the All after non-earthly signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
At the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) every computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Sternwarte (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which makes his name all the honour.
With its four mirrors, the remote pipe can also look at the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is to comprise a depth of 42 meters - and to be assembled from almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, pictures can be expected at the earliest 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescope is part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, besides it, looks into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope will be created - with a mirror average of 30 metres.
This is an illustration to see.
However, the most important impressions from the All are the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990 it has already delivered pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been searching for extrasolar planets - mainly for those inhabited.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 Planetenkandidaten had been identified since the start of the mission.
In the picture the last startup preparations are documented at the space telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot on board an Ariane5 rocket early in 2018.
The primary mirror of space infrastructure has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope: to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that ice exists at the South Pole of the Merkur.
However, there is no reliable data for this, since the messenger is far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
For decades, radar measurements have indicated that there is ice on the Merkur.
Through the trade fair probes launched in 2004 - the first to circulate around the Merkur - scientists now have certainty.

In the south of Azerbaijan many people reach a biblically high age.
There is even a long-life museum.
A trail in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan many people reach a biblically high age.
There is even a long-life museum.
A trail in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch Mountains is wildly romantic.
The small town towers over the winding road, passing densely wooded hills, charming rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
This is where the kaukasian ethnic group of the Talyschen, which is not much known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian and Aserian and is very long-lasting.
The final station is Lerik.
The small town is full of buildings from Soviet times, which do not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe come barely here, too difficult is the journey of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometres you need eight hours, because the road is only one-sided.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the testimony to the tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world", says Fatulayeva.
It is the director of the long-life museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the vita documented by about eight dozen Talyschen from the area, which shows more than 100. Fatulayeva on a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, a child still bears witness.
But the museum’s controversial star is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And, given the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, Müslümov’s age appears to be extremely dubious.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died", explained Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times, and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he was still a daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov pay for a few decades at his age?
But Rembrandt Scholz, an old scientist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the high-beds in Central Asia.
"There are also many high-altar people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also living in Sardinia extremely many very old men".
However, due to lack of documentation, there is no scientific proof of age, especially since there was no registration of persons.
Every day tastefully tasted butter.
But the fact is that the people of the region frequently reach a biblical age around Lerik.
At present there are 20 people older than 100 years.
So why do so many high-beds live here in the south?
The aseric guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talyschen.
Museumsdirektorin Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is in the diet.
But the cold-orientated diet of the Talyschen should be so healthy that the meat, bread and, above all, dairy products love and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter every day does not appear plausible from a nutritional point of view.
In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement close to the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With its 97 years, it is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter that she wears tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and one daughter, both of which are long grandparents.
Two infants are also jumping around.
In the kitchen you can prepare tea, served in the typical building-shaped fittings.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in Reih and Glied, under her headscarf she hides long dark blonde heads, which her son proudly reveals before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never took me out and kept their color.
"Shampoo I never used," says Mirzayeva.
A monthly pension is enough to live.
She has always only eaten what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, Erbsen.
I did not buy food once in the supermarket for my entire life.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
It was worst in the post-World War II period.
But everything was better than the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the Ruder.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult driven around the nation’s fatherman, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows little about borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the Ruder.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's elderly.
230 mana (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions a sum from which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayevas's long-winded son was right: 'The elderly enjoy our culture of respect'.
They live in the middle of the big family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that is no reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The word 'human rights' is missing from the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
rival rallies in Cairo reveal the country’s deep division.
The future constitution with Sharia law as a basis is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save with Pathos.
We must make the transition.
"And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in the public eye.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
For they all, so far hopelessly shattered in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a divine state on the Nile of mercies of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He almost apologized, as Mohammed Mursi said, to temporarily curtail the powers of the Constitutional Court and extend his powers to 'save the revolution'.
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a PhD title from the American University of South California, really wants to save, about which the Egyptians are, is not fully aware of the world.
Should the judiciary be deposed?
In fact, the 234 articles, dominated by the Islamist 100-member constitutional constituent assembly because in a late 15-hour parforcement stage, are in some cases worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the case-law is based on the 'principles of Islamic law'.
But what is "principles"?
That was, and is, a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the weak wording and the legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This at least suggests a new article: in all matters affecting Sharia law, the Al-Ashar University must be recruited, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great force across Sunni Islam.
This does not need to be done, but it may mean that the clergy supervises the legislation, which would in fact result in the removal of the judiciary.
Much in the draft Constitution is interpretation.
There is also a problem: civilian military justice should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak’s reign to suppress opposition.
After the dictator’s fall, up to 11,000 civilians were in military detention.
The state should also, it says in the draft, 'protect the true nature of the Egyptian family' and 'promote their morals and values'.
This is not legally formulated in such a way that state institutions, with the help of this article, could even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain terms, this means nothing more than censorship.
By the way, no article specifically states equality between men and women.
For this, another one forbids to insult or slander the Prophet Mohammed and his messenger.
But what is an insult and how it is to be punished remains unclear.
Similarly dubious is the wording that 'insulting people' is prohibited.
Is there already a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Interpretation code, like so much in the draft that Mursi has for signature and, in his words, 'very soon' will be presented to the Egyptians for the referendum.
"The Revolution has returned."
For weeks, the opposition has been opposed to Islamists’ over-power.
Tens of thousands gathered on Friday evening in the Tahrir Square in Cairo and praised to overturn the charter before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-place of the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and ex-chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei declared that the draft Constitution is "on the Müllberg of History".
Via Kurznachrichtendi Twitter, he accused the followers of Mursis to lead a "coup against democracy".
"When he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow it," said the opposition opposition opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet sprayed," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to supervise the referendum, which would invalidate it.
'The Quran is our Constitution'
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, has become a counter-demonstration, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass camp on the other Nile in front of the Cairo University.
Many disguised women and followers of the Salafists took part in it and called 'The people are demanding the application of God's law'.
They asked of Mursi: 'Calculate the land!' and prayed: 'The Quran is our constitution'.
A fight for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything started, would probably have provoked similar conditions for citizens.
It is obvious that Morsi’s supporters did not want to risk this.
The Muslim brothers said that both the opponents of the draft Constitution and the proponents had been loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
A majority of Islamists’ draft is considered safe.
'The word 'human rights does not even come before' .
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this accelerated constitutional process, which should have gone to February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chair of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were imprisoned or tried under Mubarak.
It is not because it would share their view of the world, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beaten, convicted, imprisoned for this.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains about the "world on Sunday".
Mursi’s expansion of power to all three powers in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President is de facto repealing it," says Saeda.
But democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels alone, also from the international community, looking at the ideological direction campaign on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be avoided.
One protester in Tahrir warns: 'You cast a monster that you can no longer control'.
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the world's most dirty fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Could the country's mystery of success have something to do with the local appetite on pretty dirty fish?
You can take a selection of over-zealous cheeses.
They are placed in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sports clothing.
And leave them there for a week.
For example, one of Norway's great delicacies has to imagine the wetland smell of Rakfisk.
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes here - and this stubborn smell in the air that simply does not want to disappear.
Rakfisk is punished with salt trout, which, depending on how stinking one would like its fish, is fermented up to one year in water.
If in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather becomes colder, Norway will become a feast here in Fagernes, which is now dedicated to this truly delicious speciality.
"You eat it raw and wash it down with a glass of Aquavit", says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fireguard, but as the so-called "Rakfisk General" also organizes the festival.
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Mansche Leute mag den Aquavit mehr als den Rakfisk", says Havard.
Spirituose can displace the smell.
I cost a few tips.
If one avoids putting the rack in a nose cloak, it is not bad - such as Sushi, who has a fairly long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, far poorer Norwegian epoch, when there were no cooling possibilities and fish were drinked in air-tight salt water waters in the autumn.
In the deepest winter, it was then taken out after long fermentation and consumed, without doubt, using alcohol-dampened senses.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and migrated mainly to the US.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labor market, high wages, and comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was far richer not so long ago than Norway, immigrants migrate.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - an essential, albeit strictly speaking part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But everything is really expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a proud EUR 10.
Norway does not often get into the world press, and most people do not seem to bother it.
Here we still hate to name Anders Breivik - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, we only refer to the 'incident of 22 July'.
Norway is struggling to accept that somebody in its peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970’s, Norway’s current wealth has been the main source of growth in one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waiter, distributes the round table with ripe rack and, with her long blonde hair and the tingling blue eyes, embodies the Nordic ideal.
We are a prudent people, as we say.
Your English is as much as most people here do.
We are not very indicative, we do not like any dissension.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the industry income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading to the global economic crisis, everyone was talking about money that they did not have at all, Norway kept its money exchange closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and walk in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat Rakfisk," adds it to it with unpleasant laughter.
I stand in the snow and put me for another dish - from Rakfisk I have enough.
This kind of elk-Burger is certainly something else.
But in the evening there is the back fish on the menu.
The hotel, in which I logic, is one of several venues organizing a Rakfisk dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV switch to a showmaster dressed with flies, surrounded by plates with rack.
The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What number of points do you have in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, accidents".
You are clapping and laughing.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by Aquavit.
But perhaps it is the strict darkness of the whole fish.
Mexico’s Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start.
While Mexico’s future president Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office, Will Grant from the BBC analyzes the challenges facing him and his people’s mixed feelings.
At present, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is a city that is always closed, but on Monday a ring of steel was erected, locking several important traffic routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to disturb Pendler on the road to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president Enrique Pena Nieto will retain the presidential binding and take over the nation’s leadership.
It is a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderons, Mexico has proved itself economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama this week in the Oval Office.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before joining the US president, Pena Nieto was a governor of his home country, Mexico.
In this densely populated, large part of the country surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A Direct Man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one would like to remember him.
Residents of the resort write to him the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that led to the construction of Pena Nieto, which are a great improvement on the bridges, hollow roads that once existed here.
Plaquets with their names also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI.
In particular, with regard to security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congressman Olvera acknowledges that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the accusations of the opposition, the new president lacked substance.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But, on the other hand, not many people share this view about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The town is hidden under motorway crossings and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was deployed to combat the drug gangs operating in the quarter, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind on a pile of Brachland near a large landfill.
During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in Mexico - a statistic that even surpassed the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murder of innocent women.
The critics, Pena Nietos, believe that he did not adequately address the problem of women's killings during his term of office.
But, worst of all, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building typical of the last quarter, Irinea Buendia fought with the tears when she showed me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana 2010 began suicide.
But their family believes that she was murdered by her life-sick.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed that her body was washed," Senora Buendia recalls.
There were indications that she was beaten, and the corpse was already used.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down from the wall, next to a cross that wears a single word: justice.
But they, the family said, have been denied it so far.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a sponge, a troublemaker, a girlfriend.
They want their judgement simply to be accepted and keep their mouth.
"But this is not possible if there were so many formalities and omissions," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the Presidential Bind on Saturday, he will also assume a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes over the last six years, and the new president has promised to pay particular attention to this problem during his term of office.
"I hope as President he is as governor," says the PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of this.
The public prosecutor claims that Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse.
The Public Prosecutor's Office is contrary to Bradley Mannings's accusations that he was abused in prison.
The hearing deals with Mannings time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
Defending seeks to reject the prosecution on grounds of harsh detention.
The US army is accused of sending out thousands of confidential documents.
On Friday, the Public Prosecutor tried to establish that the army mill Bradley Manning - charged with the greatest disclosure of confidential information of US history - failed to complain about the alleged abuse he had in military detention.
During a preliminary hearing in Ft Meade, Maryland, Maj Ashden Fein explained that records of weekly visits by prison officers in quantum quantum Virginia during Mannings had not received any complaints about his treatment.
One day before the interim hearing, held as a result of a request to reject the charge - Manning was already punished sufficiently by the harsh detention period - Manning had declared that he had considered suicide in prison.
The US Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stolen thousands of confidential documents during his life in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the Friday hearing, Fein with Manning performed the forms that officials had filled out in quantum military prison after their meetings with Manning during his detention, where he had been detained from July 2010 to April 2011 under reinforced detention conditions.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When fine asked him on Friday on the forms, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as a "very professional".
The forms, fine, did not contain any complaints about abuse, even though Manning officials had asked directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally, and that the officials had discussed them and indicated that they were dealing with them, but they had not been recorded.
"They wrote (after meeting the concerns) "No problems" and that did not necessarily mean that I said nothing at all," Manning said.
The judge, Oberst Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicides he mentioned a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to downgrade his observation status to "prevent injuries".
The military said that it assigned him this restrictive status - which is a stage under the suicide threat - to his and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that it was good to me, and the observatory to prevent injuries (...) to achieve a better quality of life in my view," said Manning.
Manning said on Thursday about his arrest and relocation to Kuwait, where he was detained approximately two months before he was transferred to the Marinebase Quantico prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that he considered suicide in Kuwait, and was once unaware of the heat.
Not to be able to know what is happening with him or in the outside world has been burdensome.
"My world shrunk to Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I would die in this cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
You only allowed him a mattress, a deck, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said that he tried to stay in motion, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or just sit down.
He had to sleep with light from the outside in his cell.
When he turned around at night and guards could not see his face anymore, he was raised to turn back.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formally opposed the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned an accusation that he had raised in his statement on Thursday, so he had to sleep a night naked in his cell in Quantico and face a naked watch and other prisoners in a mortal count.
Manning had declared that he had never had the opportunity to wrap himself with his deck during this count.
On Friday, Manning announced that he had closed the deck with which he could have covered himself, but he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had announced that he was forced to sleep naked in the previous night, trying to show an official that he had no danger for himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the covenant of his negotiators or his flip flops to injure himself, but not.
This night, Manning said, his negotiators, Flip flops, and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take account of his detention experience and drastically reduce his detention if he is convicted in his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will be guilty of lesser offences, while other charges considered to be too extreme are to be contested.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the Public Prosecutor is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the provisions that apply to all detainees under the highest safety precautions in quantum.
The charges against Manning include the benefit of the enemy, the illegal publication of secret services on the Internet, the transmission of national defense information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he is in danger of life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to accuse the immigrants - they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and arrived at the passport control, when the lack of trust in me spread.
A sign refers to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, insecure to which I should go.
I grew up in Central California and I was called "Mexicans" for my entire life.
An ethnic cut - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later I chose "Mexican-American".
But that was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather there was no need for cuts or tights.
I was simply American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to say in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I will not lose my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about the moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda, all those issues expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is a reason why Mexicans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to unite with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc on the model of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue Mexico’s war against the drug cartels, even though he did not mention details on that.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States entered Mexico in 1848, forcing the country’s leaders, under premeditated pressure, to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not overlooked.
So, as soon as a US government official makes mild criticism of Mexico, one hears complaints - in the Mexican press and among the country's elites - about how Americans are constraining their neighboring country's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma go on the war path.
And yet Mexico’s greatest challenge lies in the real relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about resentment?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers: people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at one point in our pedigree, a person - perhaps a parent or a large part - was not offered an opportunity in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases this person was in a profile - dark-skinned, unborn, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them.
Not Mexico.
And, although we may now live the American dream, have visited good schools and received good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we live - not Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but in terms of our loyalty, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
We are also aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican leadership.
This is based on reciprocity.
You see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And then we would not see ourselves caught behind the soap project - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, born in Guadalajara and legally migrating to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans are resenting them.
While she is American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans, whom I know, have the feeling that they do not belong to one country or another.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but none of them is rooted.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and some of the educational citizens want to resume their connections to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as a provisional "ambassador" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to that country is and exert pressure on the political leaders to step up their ties with Mexico.
Now.
That will not happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And, given the unfair distribution of income, the unbridled corruption and the violence against drugs, many of us are not sure that this is really a great country.
I am afraid you have to do this by yourself, Amigos.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a year and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grom about how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are "Mexican" when I thought.
Old Gefechte, New Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone of peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual blame, countless buildings were laid in ruins and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza are taking place near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether or not they want it - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this confusion.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first sight, optimism seems to be far from appropriate, given the current situation.
Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November continues, these weeks of struggle have strengthened the hardships on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has been controlling Gaza since 2007, are claiming to have pushed the Israelis back, even though its grouping itself had to suffer large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million Gazastre inhabitants are being sacrificed in one of the most desolating and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet succeeded in destroying Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas gains in the West Bank, controlled by Fatah’s rival, moderate Palestinian group.
And Hamas leaders may conclude that they have time on their side.
As Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas has been able to attract powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power, once considered Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken the Hamas Party, just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubelnde Hamas followers believe that Israel is an Islamist half-moon - from Lebanon to the north, where militant Hezbollah has power, through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist predisposition may face the pace of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the far-reaching and most important Arab country - at the southern edge of Israel, has changed the region’s balance in a sustainable way.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot that ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
By contrast, the Brotherhood has disappeared with Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be a player who cannot be pushed out even by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, have drawn an opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, Iron Dome, has proved its worth, and many of Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep quietly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States is steadfastly maintaining its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially among Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free from suicide bombers, not least thanks to the locking facilities that are entering the West Bank and thus into the main part of any Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal under international law, but which are becoming increasingly developed.
Netanyahu is well there, and his Likud party allied itself with an even more combative group in the run-up to the 22 January elections under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why, too, are these left-wing Palestinians dying and leaving them to their own state?
If they actually had control of the West Bank, would they not, like their counterparts in Gaza, fire rockets?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them if they dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to enforce themselves, but the Arab Spring could make them face up to the bill.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries have little to do with Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defense budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments repair their economies.
That pragmatic President Mursi met Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolise the start of a new era.
Israelis, too, should think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking timid steps towards democratisation, Palestinians will continue to be deprived of their right of self-determination - a powder keg that will undoubtedly one day explode in the Israeli occupied territories, just as a bus exploded this week in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation.
Blood missions to push Hamas back into the Gaza Strip are increasingly demanding their diplomatic tribunal over the years.
Both sides need a push from outside
The correct answer is those who are represented by the more sensible representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel cedes territories for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the cease-fire will give outsiders more influence in enforcing this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must stop the supply of arms to the Gaza Strip, and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, complemented by territorial dust and a common Jerusalem.
Outsiders of Arab nations should also agree with Hamas and Fatah.
This would be more done to create a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama, too, must play its part in encouraging Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he failed to imagine his own peace plan.
Far from being in the white house, it seems that he would be equally reluctant to participate.
But that is a deplorable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has an essential interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packets come into force.
Health warnings and body parts on neutral green packs equal to all tobacco brands.
The world’s first laws on uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive-green lid, which are also printed with dramatic pictures showing sick body parts and infants and children with cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packs in the brand names printed in identical, small font is the following Saturday.
In this way, Australia introduces the most stringent regulations for tobacco packaging worldwide.
The Australian Federal Government wants to stop young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government is proceeding from studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking with 26 will not start smoking with 99% likelihood even after that.
"One can already see young-age children understand the message that they try to apply the tobacco companies with their brand image," said Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek.
Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smoking in the world, and the changes will have little effect on the profits of the multinationals, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The Tabaklobby fought hard against the laws.
This would mean that the laws would favour the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and more easily accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian subjects will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others say that laws have stimulated their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarette nets and silicone bags to cover intolerable packaging has risen enormously since the companies British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed two months ago at the top Australian Court of Justice with their challenge to the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units of wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
This is a good deal for us.
According to experts, the hooks in the popularity of social media are precisely the population group to which the plan is directed.
A number of Australian laws have banished tobacco companies from television advertising, banned them from becoming sports sponsors, and forced most traders to stop selling cigarettes on the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international pages.
"Whoever markets tobacco and only has a small area to apply for its products does not get around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, healthcare researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has found an increase in experience reports on brands written by "ordinary people".
You have to ask yourself: is this just a private person who finds such a great favour in Marlboro cigarettes that she even takes a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that, instead of focusing on marketing, industry is concentrating on dealing with new laws.
Indeed, it has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organisation about unfair trade restrictions, even though none of the countries trade more with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has had talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country in 2001 to drive photographic warnings.
They have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
tougher laws are considered in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show themselves defiant.
The pictures do not affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a kick and get rid of the box", says Victor El Hage when you buy a cigarette box, where a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
Frankly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and that is my little girl.
James Yu, owner of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in the downtown of Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to perform its shelves.
"Earlier I used an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four", says Yu.
"The government should simply have banned cigarettes completely - then we would have told us okay, that was's, we make dense," he obviously adds.
In a constantly electrified world, it is nice to be even bored.
I spent this Thanksgiving unexpectedly five hours in the airport when our plane ran out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flying.
So I had enough time to give me some thought to boredom.
I do not want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is quite nervous - even if books, magazines and iPhones are available (and of course tax-free shopping).
But more and more academics and childhood development experts lead boredom rather than a positive one.
When it comes to them, it is okay for us - and our children - to be bored occasionally.
In this way, the brain is forced to lose in interesting ideas, which may encourage creativity.
And because most of us today are almost constantly on the one or other screen, we no longer benefit from the benefits of boredom.
Should we therefore welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I come back to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively topical phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see this.
"Indeed, boredom has a very long history," he says.
The house walls of Pompejis account for a Latin graffiti over boredom which dates back to the first century.
Then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associated professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that Langeweile had the experience of "trying to do a satisfactory job but not being able to do it".
It is therefore a long time different from apathy that the person is not employed, but that wants to be.
In the case of apathy, however, there is no urge to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a "disturbance of the attentiveness process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time only slowly passes away".
This can almost be heard as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that, although these two conditions may be related, people have been left to see the problem in their surroundings or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even if we only have difficulty concentrating ourselves.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - for example: "The untiring mind: the definition of boredom from the point of view of attention", which appeared in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment, at which participants listen to a band where a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighbouring room, which had nothing to do with the content, and others heard it in low volumes, so it was hardly visible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who listened to the barely audible television offered to feel more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems concentrating on themselves, could not find any reason for this and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If you try to focus on a difficult or arduous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If, on the other hand, one exercises a one-size-fits-all activity - "just as the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help to avoid feeling bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Crimean, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people physically attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to wander around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit down" says Professor Fenske.
At some point we all get boring - my late flight, a loud speaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people are boring more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale to boredom vulnerability" in the 1980s.
On the scale there are statements like "many things I must do repeat themselves and are monoton" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything".
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are becoming boring more often than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are quite a tight pile.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in contacting almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a Pager.
He found that 32% of the pre-growing in the school and in doing the homework were bored, while 23% said to be bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents had to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentage of boredom has risen or decreased.
However, he is certain that 'Youth is perceived to be particularly boring', mainly because children and teenagers have no great influence on their daily lives.
So back to my question of origin: is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall victim to gambling or drugs to alleviate them, as studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors are investigating the relationship between boredom and creativity, which is Professor Vodanovich who has been exploring the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," says Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what to do best.
If you are boring and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, you will be happy.
However, television can provide happiness in the short term, but these are flourishing in the long term.
So if you have enough iPad to your bored child, you can get rid of the boredom, but it has not learned to talk or control yourself, Professor Fenske says.
And he adds: "Self-control transfers itself from one situation to another".
The child learns not only to maintain, but also to gain more self-control in other areas.
I do not think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we consider them too critical.
Instead, our aim should be to feel well off the constant activity and technology reporting.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds as if we had to be boring more often, but boredom is the tortuous, indefatigable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people in reality are only looking for a way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly being overruled, it is difficult to worry when the noise is broken once.
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new Marihuanalaw.
The 19-year-old Community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is standing in the south-east of Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in this state: possession of a few marijuana brokes and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a Septembertag by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer Marihuana had found a car, Orozco was charged for the possession of drugs and drug utensils - Kavaliersdelicts, each with a penalty of $100 - and received a court appointment.
"We are treated like criminals", says Orozco.
But is it also one?
In the uncertain weeks following the decision of the state to legalise small quantities of marijuana for its own use, the answer to hundreds of small drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of regulatory excesses around Marihuana are already being dropped here and in the State of Washington, which approved similar measures.
Police authorities no longer have adults over 21 years for small-scale possession, which is legally allowed once the new laws come into force in the coming weeks.
But public prosecutors in the conservative districts of Colorado have announced that existing marijuana offences are still persecuting and citing people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denvers to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new state-licensed Marihuanas shops from opening in their communities.
"This situation develops so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, Chief of Police in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington are also scrambling their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline for 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states in terms of the regulation of Marihuana, where the drug was only legalised for medical purposes and then for own consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well suited to orientation," says Brian E. Smith, Speaker of the Supervisory Authority for Spirituoses in Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We do not have a real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December, making it the end point of a grey zone where the state licensing system does not exist yet, but the possession is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time - for example, how to agree to the state requirement of 'adequate access' to licensed Marihuana by prohibiting cannabis operations within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to find a site for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area", says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his staff in Aurora, stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute smaller marijujuana offences for people over 21 years, and that the police would "immediately" not seek to prosecute these offences.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce municipal regulations to regulate the cultivators of Marihuana and continue to persecute drug traffickers.
In Weld County in the north of Colorado District Attorney Ken Buck has a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana ownership, mainly to induce consumers to move away.
At present, 119 people have to take responsibility for possession of about 50 grams or less Marihuana in court, although many have also been charged for other offences.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute offences that were at the time of the crime," said Buck in a statement.
The reactions are ambivalent even in places like the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the Marihuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer shows adults for possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but it also decided not to allow all outstanding acquis procedures to be dropped.
"I don't think I waste my time enforcing the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile Marihuana’s personal consumption with the complexities of government and legal systems.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state encouraged deep-seated intercourse among local officials with regard to the great green experiment.
District attorneys are a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who is accused of marijuana crimes in court and acts locally as spokesperson for the national organisation for the reform of Marihuanas laws.
"They have spent so much of their lives on prosecuting people for not yet able to accept legalization," he believes.
As the first states to treat small quantities of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national examples of the legalisation of drugs.
While advocates and government officials are preparing for an age of legal sales, they are also nervously awaiting instructions from the Federal Government to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of Marihuana at federal level as a criminal offence.
Supporters of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers medical marijuana, the Federal Government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, the Obama administration’s former drug-policy adviser, believes that, while criminal officials are unlikely to enter doors to confiscate smaller quantities of drugs, they are likely to be reluctant to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana deals under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipalities approved Moratoris for new Marihuana shops, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, adopted a six-month ban, which is likely to be adopted next week.
"We do not want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this amendment of the law.
We look at what the community has decided and not what the state has chosen.
There are still many questions to be asked.
Petronella Wyatt: I was honored from Oxford because I am Tory.
Not only university students from today are being attacked for their views.
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother visited the university, which I once thought was the world's largest knowledge temple, as a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilisation - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks after my entry in the Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had to study history - I had packed my suitcases again and brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father broke together in tears.
My friends were confused.
It was a bit noisy at night.
The author A N Wilson explained schelmisch, I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I left.
Yes, because I was suffering from systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I was harassed only for one reason - a reason that seemed to be so narrow and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: my now deceased father, Woodrow Wyatt, was an important adviser to Margaret Thatchers and I support the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, according to current reports, a new generation of moderate-right students suffer similar persecution.
The organised and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them called last week for the same equality protection that benefits gay men, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the June Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College indicate that they are "often actively isolated, personally assaulted and declared undesirable due to their political views".
They call for a place in their college’s equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent documentary of political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which portrayed Tories as a centrist and neo-Nazi.
It was shown, among other things, graduates Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, who traveled in a Rolls-Royce and projected with silver-coloured suit and silver-filled footstock.
At other universities, conservative students say that they are regarded as 'scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees'.
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the conservative student association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing trend towards universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without having met us at all".
Samuel Roberts, 21 and story student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "unpleasant".
"This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an unbelievably shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university voted not to grant Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an honorary title due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even deterred Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students get to know themselves and the tutors, I received a foretaste of the future events.
I learned that the Tutores did not only tolerate the killing of Tory students, but even happily participated in it.
Political issues, such as the mountain workers' movement, the privatisation and rejection of the government of sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime, found their way into the rugged areas of the Tutorium.
At my first of these events, I should translate French texts from the 18th century into English, and what should come then, I was not prepared.
"Miss Wyatt", said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph".
I stumbled on this.
Pitt was a small man with a face like a cake, and pretty stuck.
"Would Thatcher supporters like to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students kicked.
In my view there were tears.
"I suggest that you take a few French hours in your leisure time - that is, if you are not too busy with your social activities", closed me to Pitt.
I returned to my room with hanging head.
This evening I was sitting in college only at dinner, when someone put me slightly on my shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year called James, who appeared as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are", he said friendly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone suspected to be Tory is harassed.
For me, it is bad enough, but they know your father Margaret Thatcher is close, so it will be worse for you.
Most of the Tory first semesters suggest to be Labour supporters.
In a local pub I tried later to hide me.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A student in the field of philosophy, politics and economics, who ironically visited the Eton College as conservative, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist".
You are polluted.
Other students shared his views.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?", asked me one.
They beat each other, or?
I felt that homosexuals had to feel more liberal in the United States.
Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after the darkness broke down?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me, before my mental eye, were becoming a figer of the equation and isolation.
The only tutor to be seen openly as Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History, who had his seat in my college.
He was not only hated for being a Conservative, but also for consulting Thatcher on foreign policy and for writing speeches for her.
He was rare.
He hated the place, found him provincial and petty, and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic narrative spective.
In 1997 he took a professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he told me.
I began to move between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hate Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed unfavourable.
During his time in the fifties, all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said.
They would never do so, not in my city of dreamy tower spikes.
Even my communist friends always behaved perfectly.
His humid eyes were cloudy.
All in all, give us an opportunity.
I'm sure you only have to leave you.
It would break my heart if you were going.
exhausted by my frequent journeys to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, including Tory followers, had succumbed to pressure and sent his convictions.
During a tutorial in the following week, when another storyteller seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly crushed by shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to "brainwashing" and called it "old trousers".
The relief took only a short time.
It was my father who beat the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes left my chinese.
When they went, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
I am happy to mention a weird slump.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that produced not only 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hides itself behind an undeserved call for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of the Couture", opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This was acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of the Couture", a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the Haute Couture were put together, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace", he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinct clientele.
Valentino always felt fascination for the sticky and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be visible until March 3, there are numerous private letters and photos with the signature of the exquisite aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan to the Princess Marie-Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophy of his social ascent from the modest modemaker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet.
Being in love with the noble must not be detrimental.
"At least they don't take their kicks off on your beautiful carpet as they do some beautiful celebrities from pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We all rejoiced when we were invited to his house in Gstaad", explains the wizard of "Heini" Thyssen, close friend with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of the celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
On every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music recognized and felt his influence.
"All entrants felt important and loved," recalls the "Top Model", which started their career at the week of Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art" says them in conclusion.
Fashion of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of confusion, rather of mutual happiness.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60 metre-long run that proposes a roll-out: the user takes the seat of the model and goes along the runway to admire a dreamlike "Audienz" wearing masterpieces by Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti contributed to "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather, owned by Kaiserin Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion puppies, names like Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg radiate.
Naty Abascal and Modemacher, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I still remember perfectly.
It was a Hose, a shirt, a Weste type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designs.
"I prefer him to all others because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the ex-Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princesses and opinion leaders in the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget for the first time she was wearing a Valentino.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the nineties it was finally there.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my vetter, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a dragged upper part with a decorative that makes his name honor.
"It was a real dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino doesn't depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocracy living between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess D'Arenberg preserves her evening dress of the fashion maker "with absolute care" because a dress is not only a dress, but also the associated memories".
The King of Fashion
The great finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion maker called his sewers) were necessary to produce this ivory coated soap with pearls, twelve different embroideries and a four and a half metre long sweat.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the Kundinnen of the supreme society".
For years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the honor legion, accentuates Garavani as many honors as any of the husbands of his customers.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his calm, his well-kept and perfect exterior", says D'Arenberg.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala dinner in the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the tombs Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
"He was mad; the time leaves no traces to him".
And this says a princess...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human pets of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the Indonesian volcano’s carriers put their lives and health at risk if they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn their lives by bringing sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island Java.
To do so, he must rise every day down to the bottom of his crater, where the sulphur-containing gas emitted from the earth is consolidated in contact with the air.
After browing large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, it transports them into two bamboo baskets on its shoulders over the curved paths of stones.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises up to an altitude of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to climb in the tortoise speed, keeping the balance and taking care of their steps so that they do not turn off and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the slopes of Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocent for each kilo of sulphur they dispose of.
At the top, they train themselves the way between the tourists photographing them as circus creatures and run with the fateful heavy baskets three kilometres to the Waage, which has set up a mining company a little further down at an altitude of 1850 metres.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who since 1960 uses the presence in the volcano and (never better) his workers, to which they pay 662 Indonesian Rupien (5 Eurocent) for every kilo of sulphur.
This is then sold to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocent), because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of string woods, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamically and even lead sugar.
"As we usually carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) for every way," explains Anto, who normally makes three tracks a day.
It takes three hours for each stretch, after which it is completely accomplished, but at the end of the day it has 138,000 rupees (11,5 Euro).
What looks like a wretched wage for such an unbearable effort, however, is three times what he would earn with field work.
"The diarrhea of mine workers here, where 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) are paid on the day, and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros) is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a Maurer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6,2 euros) on the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near, and for a reason that is so important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I have married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I have brought them to Java to convert them to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, husks frequently and his eyes have traveled due to the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been putting his life at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left his first track, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathed with difficulty, often hushed and his eyes have traveled from the volcano due to the toxic gases.
This is the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
"I'll work here for two years, because I want to get a store or learn Spanish or French", he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This friendly and intelligent, but curious young man may work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a Tragesel.
He shares a dirty wood hut with other tears and is standing at 2 p.m. every morning because the sulphur is also emitted at night, where his characteristic yellow colour shines in darkness.
The shadows challenging, he rises in the light of a small forehead lamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money, in the crater.
Approximately 400 carriers load the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite their huge profits, the mining company did not mechanize the sulphur reduction in order to save costs, and did not provide any equipment to the carriers working on their own account and paid for by weight.
You will not receive any portion of the 30,000 rupees (2,5 Euro) surcharge per photoapparatus which the guardians of this natural park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1,2 Euro) require tourists who will be able to photograph the volcano and the human tragedy.
"This work is for the animals and not for the people" protests Madrusin, a fortified, 42-year-old carrier working three decades since leaving school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues, "as long as it goes" because he needs the money for raising his three children aged between 10 and 18.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and jumping the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and the mine workers settle in the thick pillars that rise out of the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course, except the usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the basket.
With the basket on his back, Unainik is able to carry 50 kg with its 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano transported from three trucks to a goat's path between the Gebüsch to the Tamansari camp in 18 kilometres.
"I'm not going to retire, I'll die here because the volcano was my whole life" explains Unainik, opening his mouth wide in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder with his 30 years also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but the indignity keeps generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: those who work as a human burden on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singapore blame for not having children, for their careers, the stress and costs of real estate and child education.
'The population of Singapore must grow'.
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfil our citizenship and create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless - or precisely because of this - at the beginning of this year in Singapore they became a viral video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local sprays such as "shooting will be a bao" (Laib) in the oven to make itself funny about the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which has shot the video, has the hope that the advertising spot reaches in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to induce people to fulfill their "national duty".
This is just for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
It is the biggest problem in that country.
When it comes to reproduction, we are the worst in the world, so we noticed that this is a subject that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as marketing perfume with Pheromones or organizing speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
Possibility that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: why not do we not do something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Anyone who does not take this issue easily is Singapore’s government.
Each year, it spends $1,300 on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of government for spouses and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything has not been successful so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city in the south-east of Asia, well known for its governance conservatism and strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time that this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans get more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of the National Population Agency's marriage and family policy, says that this is due to 'better education' and 'greater career opportunities'.
"This has made it possible for people to have much more options in terms of life goals than to marry and to form a family," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single-handers and the reticence of the marriage and birth, the result of which is the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in migration to counteract the reduction of the population has led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely disguised xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticised for keeping wages low and failing to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore’s ruling party achieved its worst election since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected Effects
While the falling birth rate has the well-known impact on the economic growth of a nation that has tax revenues, health costs, and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small homes are built.
For example, it already has an impact on the housing market.
The municipal development authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe shawls" and can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great success in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person, and that they discourage the construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe shawls" can be sold much faster than larger units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer guidance to the developers, who had previously put obstacles in the way if they wanted to build too many small units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the talks with the Singapore countries working in the financial district will have no significant impact.
"People are heavily streamed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out of many" says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"For me it is important to have my own money and time" says another man about twenty years old.
Men and women lead their careers, the stress and the cost of property and education as reasons for not having children.
That is why the Singapore people have the last word when it comes to getting children - that is where the government can do so much.
The offline Private offline is online private.
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "that area of private life where you are entitled to protection from any type of interference".
What is private for someone under 16?
How is this definition applied to its everyday lives and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he makes known on the Internet situations he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people aged 10 to 15 who are often on the net.
In four of the cases, they linked the term "something very own" at a personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"My deepest mysteries would not be disclosed in a post" says the 10-year-old Jorge in trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with friends.
"I would not share a photo that is not from me, or from someone who makes the Dummkopf" he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked, of crimes, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine consecutive in Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Also included the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I wrote on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if someone replies to me, I just upload it" adds it.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends" he gives.
He replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone loved him a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask.
"This does not frighten me because we have something in common, for example music", he gives.
After giving the boy, no one made any hints or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If someone restricts me or asks me, I just remove it from my account" he gives.
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy is not unaware of experiences that are now known as cyber bullying.
The friend of a friend was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victim has not closed the account.
'He has done it privately.'
Afterwards, he explained a number of steps to configure a user account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in inconvenient or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do that if he is unsympathetic to me or I want to expel him one.
"But I know that this is cyber bullying" he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher for English with university degrees in education and learning, believes that in order to orientate children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information, but with the appearance of these pages the rules of the game changed," she says.
Porras explained that the academy Marc Prensky, holder of a master title in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" shaped these terms of explanation of the phenomenon.
The digital natives are the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them where we are still learning" he says.
He states that this is a complex subject, because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what may be disseminated, published or said, at an age when maturity is not sufficient.
"They should also be selectable if they are most important to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is to ask them questions that they think about.
"To tell you they should not do it, does not work," he says.
Porras then calls some possibilities: there are things you don't want to tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of you, how that you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
Did you ask the other people beforehand for permission if you labeled photos of celebrations?
And another question: must everyone know what you do at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they must act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet deals with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educator, commented that it is vital that parents read the social networks directives carefully.
If they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening one user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what you may share or publish" he explains.
According to Guardia, children must be reminded of the lesson 'You should not speak with strangers'.
Closing of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima declaration
The 6th Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) today ended in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and should theoretically be signed by the seven governing parties present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the 6th Ordenal Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur.
On questions about the text, they indicated that the content was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in short statements.
Journalists' access to information on the summit was restricted at any time.
During the day, only the image of the presidential meeting was transferred in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulated among journalists was received by the press spokesmen of some of the governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which aroused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
Afterwards, Peru’s presidential office sent the media an email with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it was the declaration of Humala, not the official document at the end of the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South America Summit - Arab States (ASPA), and the press, too, did not publish the so-called Lima declaration that had been announced beforehand, despite forceful invitations.
On the official website of the ASPA you can see that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were available to journalists, but they greatly restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment by the Court of Justice of The Hague, which settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would adopt the IGH decision, which begins on Monday in The Hague, in the process of establishing the Lima against Santiago, to listen to the pledges of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences that we are currently making in this international court," said Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will continue to be a country that adheres to international laws, seeking peaceful solutions to disputes, concluding agreements and submitting itself to the international courts," adds Piñera and greets Humala with a hand in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would be subject to the IGH was made after Colombia, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which deemed it a serious mistake to lodge a complaint against the Bogotá Agreement, which agreed to submit to the rulings of this international court.
At the summit, the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 after his president Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The hospitable President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after the lunchtime in Lima.
The Head of State publishes the final document, which stated that 16 decisions were taken and that the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were established on a total investment amount of $17 billion.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of Unasur will 'take significant steps towards the objective of South American citizenship, which we will extend the decisions on residence rights'.
He informed us that measures would be taken to 'improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity in cities and against organised transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the case of natural disasters'.
With the crisis in Europe, 'economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not assume triumphant traits, but should serve to expand our output and to show our peoples a better future', added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas...and thus unite our countries and develop new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a read-out statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvian, which would move from the coast to Brazil on the cross-axis of its area, and two of which would provide a better connection with Ecuador, although it did not give any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations" from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect emphasised at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before he began his participation in the regional meeting that, on Saturday in Mexico, he expected a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, in order to respect the maritime conflict following a judgment by Bogotá in question by the IGH.
"Perhaps I will meet tomorrow (Saturday) with President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also requires talks with Nicaragua," he emphasised.
"I hope to say to President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilised and as respectful as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they intend to be present at Enrique Peña Nieto, the new president of that country.
As part of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc in the run-up to the adoption of the 2013 action plan, which is intended to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the region's defence.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru has the Presidency at the time of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn to integrate citizens," says Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective, whereby 'South America can actually learn from Europe'.
Correa, who attended the 6th summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, declared to the state television in Peru that the Europeans were 'killed in the Second World War and in other conflicts' and 'today are practically a fatherland'.
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that drives the members of Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community;but there are still reactionary sectors seeking a return to the past," he warned.
President Ecuadors also advocated the reorganisation of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the guidance of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to something, and in return we always sign the South Americans all.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission has its headquarters in Washington and is funded by the United States," he declared as an allusion to the political asylum granted to Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured him that he did not regret this decision, because he did not betray his principles, but did so with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time there were 'justified assumptions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and its proceedings would not be respected'.
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary, which asked him to make a mockery on his territory for an alleged sexual crime, while 'Swedish jurisprudence allowed this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out through the Ecuadors message in London'.
Correa explained that the risk would be that the health and mental condition of Assange would be affected.
"Since he is in our message, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has an easy problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," said the head of state, Ecuadors.
However, there is a risk that he will close physical and mental damage because he is trapped in a tight space and cannot carry out physical exercises outside.
"That would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the message from Ecuadors in London was the granting of a liberator to travel to Ecuador, and that this would be in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe's.
We are not dealing with human rights, we are not addressing this word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, is conducting a series of proceedings on various European instances," he said.
And 'if Britain grants this licence tomorrow, I think that is done'.
And if Sweden stopped Mr Assange at the message from Ecuadors in London or via Skype, as Swedish jurisprudence was allowed, and in other cases did, the problem was dealt with.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm itself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate is mediocrity, evil intent and lies that discourage freedom of expression.'
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the bad and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek and blackmail for profit," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador will no longer be dominated by such journalists 'and not by bankers or hegemonic and spirited bourgeois countries', and he anticipated that, in re-election, he will 'deepen the revolution in order to continue the way in this direction'.
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organism must 'remain tough and not allow opportunism and no coup d'état to be legally held', because it 'destroys the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay'.
President Ecuadors also considers the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which favored the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, to be 'absolutely justified'.
At the moment, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be treated extensively so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also trusted a good deal of disputes over the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice, saying that 'it is right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies if both countries commit themselves to adopting the judgment, even if it is very harsh'.
With regard to the possibility that he is acting as a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador in order to achieve his third mandate, he suggested that he 'sees this possibility with much optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult'.
Correa insured that if he lost the February 2013 elections, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never been interested in power personally, but under such unfair circumstances as Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was it that guaranteed this likely victory, so I must assume that responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as President, then I would withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That is decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who has told me that he has traveled to Cuba for a planned, routine treatment, and that he would be expected to travel to Cuba after the election campaign.
"In no case does it mean a fall in the state of health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State took part today in Lima on the 6th Summit of the Union's Heads of State and Government of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for greater regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of AIDS's death today is too late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the results of the investigation: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb fell," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "mitigate" without noticeable success.
He hidden it before his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such commitment that he celebrated his 43 birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which at the beginning of the 1990s was difficult to imagine when there were many doubts, few treatments and more stigmata.
At the time, even the director of a IMSS clinic refused to adopt "because it led to a dead end."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, there are still many people in the clinic who know nothing about their illness, where the virus has already done damage and exhausted their immune system, and who are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today is that the survival of a patient who takes treatment in good time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," explained the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was supported by a reputable scientific publication in April of this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the person’s immune system at the start of treatment, and that those greater opportunities that are not drug-dependent: up to 30 years at a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years at a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above statements mean that those who receive HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25 can 'easily be 75 years old as long as they are under control', said this expert.
In order to be able to correct this progress, it is important to remember that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report of ONUSIDA), it is still true that 60% of patients registered in the national database have died since AIDS appeared.
In 2011 alone in Jalisco, 255 people died, and by May of this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is insured that since 2005 there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines.
- So why do people still die from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
That is my opinion, and that is the case in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have had no supply problems with the medicines, and the problem is that people come to a very advanced state because they do not know their state of infection, that is, in very late phases of the disease.
It makes a suggestion that 'nineteen out of ten patients come to us if they already have accompanying infection, and in order to be able to influence global mortality, more early diagnosis is needed, which is why all those who need it must be offered massive detection tests.'
This proposal is endorsed by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Aid Prevention Committee in Jalisco) and also by patients such as Fabrizio, who carried out his test at a private laboratory, for the only reason that he had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the Kaposi Sarkom (a carcinogenic tumour) which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different if you know that you have AIDS.
Some think they will die, and do not want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I prefer to place three times", you say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, driving sport and taking the drugs.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like any other.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony those who are now afraid of the world AIDS day.
They should test when they belong to the risk group, the sooner they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Kondome behind the Ladentisch
There are great gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In those places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were given individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is good, but still there are people who do not have access to a condom", he said.
The risk individuals for new infections include young people.
"What do you need?" is a common mockery of social workers, orientation staff in schools, staff in pharmacies and healthcare systems who do not want to expose themselves to young people, the correspondent assured the correspondent.
He proposed reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the dock, but also in public toilets of facilities often visited by young people.
It is not intended to promote promiscuity.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether to be distributed under his administration Preservative.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who already practise sexual activity," he put it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is located at the fourth place in national terms of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13 in relation to HIV.
92% of the contagion takes place via sexual intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV, because there are 4 or 5 people in any registered case who do not know.
Once the United States Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the Vitro Group's obligations, which has been achieved through a trade course in Mexico, a disastrous precedent will be set for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country that has payment problems.
It could be said, therefore, that the procedures for the survival of companies that permit Mexican laws do not apply in the country of the Stars and Stripes in conflict with international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the ruling by Judge Harlin Hale at the Court in Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas on June 15 leads Mexican companies to be helpless to confiscate their property beyond the river Bravo.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to call the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge points out that creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, headquartered in New Orleans, first of all, says that the main race is the trade course dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for the insolvency of companies with transnational profiles is not known.
Indeed, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law was created for the unification of international trade law, using the American Law Institute as a mediator.
Secondly, the judgment stipulates that, without the votes of the companies, the necessary majority would not have been achieved for the restructuring of the liabilities after the acknowledgement of the liabilities that Vitro's subsidiaries had with their parent company.
However, this possibility is recognised by Mexican laws.
Indeed, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose obligations have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Commercial Courses).
It is also true that, after withdrawing the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, who defended Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the Geier Funds, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45% against 37%.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is guilty of his difficult situation from 2008, in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States, which shook the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family runs counter to the same appeal court, so that the vote takes place in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not granted, the Cerciorare objection, which calls for the trial to be reviewed by a higher body, in this case by the United States Supreme Court.
The seriousness of this case is that the court has left aside a document sent by the Mexican Government under the figure amicus curiae (friend of the court), which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro under the law on trade courses, and which points out that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States bankruptcy law.
It also points out that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Two-band carmbole: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the announcements of the Mexican air traffic trade unions against the former owner, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent administration, have not progressed several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Association Association of Pilots) has finally made progress.
The request made by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal proceedings against the National Bank and Securities Commission, which is accused of hindering the judiciary.
Afterwards, the Supervisory Authority systematically refused to inform the Republic’s Chief Executive Officer of a transaction carried out by the Contractor in order to withdraw from the Trustee Account F/589 of the Bank IXE to the name Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is umzingelt.
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, complemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In the run-up, the Canacintra (the national chamber of the processing industry) has achieved to unite the governors in the south-east, in order to resist the monumental establishment, which partly destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all industrial threats.
ACTA is dead
Because the government failed to explain to a Senate request under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English acronym ACTA, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken, although the Senate had not considered the possibility, because it considered them to be violating freedom of expression in social networks.
Homex Long-term Homex
In order to pay long-term liabilities without compromising short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex offers stock market certificates of more than 500 million pesos.
The emissions are the first of four identical emissions, which promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Foundation of Competival
Established from NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading companies in information technology, a group of companies was established under the name Competival, whose objective is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment is more than $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world champion of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to the basket port for more than 60 years and traveled the whole world.
Less in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the history of the basketball of the country as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a lower-class player, player of the first national league, proxy and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball association.
"For my life, I have set up many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, the chief executive of the National Team and President of the Association in the 90s", Reyes remembered himself at a visit to Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
'Basketball was my life'.
Reyes is not exaggerated with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart of Bayamón
The most emotional memories are those who remember his time at the Vaqueros from the middle of the 1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as a member or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years I enjoyed most, because I have been part of eight championships of Vaqueros since 1967, either as managing director, co-executive or trainer.
It was many years of fulfilment, including the five championships after each other from 1971 to 1975.
And then I passed with a championship in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then on "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager, says Reyes.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a trainer and employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m big player.
Do you want him?'
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players ever had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, a freelance specialist, who was one of our best shippers.
I still know, as he said, that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would provide another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but it was already out of a distance because it was already at the top of the federation in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his fulfilment and those of Mincy in the national team.
I still know when, for the first time, we won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the USA.
After that, the World Cup in 1990, in which we gave the fourth place, which should have been bronze, had it not been that Canadian referee who let us repeat the last game for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the World Cup in 1990 the best national team you have ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as those who won against the Dream Team at the Olympic Games 2004.
But my favorite is the team of America's 1991 games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the team of the USA a battle, as they won the Bronze World Championship against us.
At that team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculín (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 because of a knee failure.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure, was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the locked players because of the events on the Panamerican games in Mar del Plata, we won the Gold Medal against any forecast.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
That was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculín.
And this without taking his career into account in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys I like the work of Leo Arill well.
What do you think is the best you have achieved in Verband?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 90s until 17 teams in a season.
What do you still have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys play in Ponce, for example, only in their area and only meet in the national playoffs at teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children make unnecessary travel and games.
At least I see the result of the compulsory training and courses for trainers, table officials and referees.
I am proud of this.
What do you do today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and then go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the society of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a unscrupulous, insidious and rigging businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros, producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved birthplace Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that he liked most," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were in Dallas for the celebrations of the harvest.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and subsequent series, was at Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, said her publicist Jeffrey Lane.
He made all the joy he knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life in full trains", said Gray in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed in 1992, and he admitted that he had drunk a lot over years.
In 1995 a malignant tumor was found in his liver, and he was subjected to transplantation.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman was known on television as a nice type in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "enchanting Jeannie" of the television company NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is placed on his head when he meets an attractive "Dschinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He was also a performer of two comedies that were broadcast only briefly, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His films include "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charming odious J.R., which made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS TV chain over the Ewing Clan and other figures in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot on J.R.?", the expectation for an episode of full emotion, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were raised in betting houses.
The series reached an audience record in that time.
When the answer was known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million spectators who converted the "Dallas" into the second most popular entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was Kristin, the sponge of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had shortened them and threatened to portray them as prostitutes if they did not lose the city, but others also had reasons to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a sturdy businessman and untreated husband who sought to leave his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what should be on the tomb of J.R.", said Hagman in 1988.
It should be called 'here the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing'.
This is the only business he has not won.
Victoria Principal, co-actress of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "huge personality on and outside the screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of people in the world and remains in our hearts, who were lucky to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just shot, informed the transmitter.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT about how the loss of Hagmann in the series would be treated.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she received Larry during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck at the theatre stage in New York at the beginning of the 1950s, after which he served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
He met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her there.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and long lived in the Californian town of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I have not written anything that I thought could harm someone or interfere with him in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet them when their operations are imminent and then," he explained in 1996.
I would like to give them some consolation, such as "no fear, it is a bit inconvenient the first time, but it will go well".
He also fought against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The beginning of the courses that study the "End of the World" study.
Every week, students study apocalyptic issues, such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
Each semester, when the religious professor decided to hold a course at the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the "long backward count" of the Mayan calendar on December 21, of which many people believed it was the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what it should expect in the following two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmaggedon", and a growing conflict, involving Israel, the place from which the Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I did not notice that this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever there" said Charmé this week the student at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes what has happened in the world today, as if we were 30 days away, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers this semester, which should be the last in history, courses about the "end of the world".
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "media, culture and the end of the world."
Every week, students study apocalyptic issues, such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material reaches the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and studied how to compare them with real life.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an accompanying professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course called "The End of the World".
"We do not accept 2012 so that we always keep the option of restarting the course, in the event that the world does not sink," said Restall.
Despite the "imminent decline" students must study, create projects and participate in audits.
In Penn State, the final examinations are carried out on the eve of the apocalypse, which is why students have no other chance of continuing to work until the night, where the world is supposedly coming to an end, said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places" said Restall about his course for students with high average who filled with 35 students.
Weekly before the start of semester we received e-mails from students who asked if places were still free.
Students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what the people do to console themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectoral or religious mentality is actually only a question of consolation or its absence.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and sickness explains to have seen all apocalyptic films.
"I never heard anything from a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students questioned - and less a professor - explained to believe in the last date of 21 December.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Mayas, and in a certain way we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
But he realizes that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that brings back several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased this speculation.
"People don't think so elsewhere," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, quickly replies to the question of whether he would know a course about the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world," he wrote as a hint of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days the last court was spoken, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophized that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period that would end the world.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they would like to celebrate "the end of the world".
"Maybe I call a few friends so that we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
