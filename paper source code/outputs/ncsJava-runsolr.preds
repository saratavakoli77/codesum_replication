test4482	main worker run loop . repeatedly gets tasks from queue and executes them , while coping with a number of issues : 1 . we may start out with an initial task , in which case we don ' t need to get the first one . otherwise , as long as pool is running , we get tasks from gettask . if it returns null then the worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration parameters . other exits result from exception throws in external code , in which case completedabruptly holds , which usually leads processworkerexit to replace this thread . 2 . before running any task , the lock is acquired to prevent other pool interrupts while the task is executing , and then we ensure that unless pool is stopping , this thread does not have its interrupt set . 3 . each task run is preceded by a call to beforeexecute , which might throw an exception , in which case we cause thread to die ( breaking loop with completedabruptly true ) without processing the task . 4 . assuming beforeexecute completes normally , we run the task , gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterexecute . we separately handle runtimeexception , error ( both of which the specs guarantee that we trap ) and arbitrary throwables . because we cannot rethrow throwables within runnable . run , we wrap them within errors on the way out ( to the thread ' s uncaughtexceptionhandler ) . any thrown exception also conservatively causes thread to die . 5 . after task . run completes , we call afterexecute , which may also throw an exception , which will also cause thread to die . according to jls sec 14 . 20 , this exception is the one that will be in effect even if task . run throws . the net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterexecute and the thread ' s uncaughtexceptionhandler have as accurate information as we can provide about any problems encountered by user code .

test4740	creates a string representation of the double argument . all characters mentioned below are ascii characters . if the argument is nan , the result is the string " nan " . otherwise , the result is a string that represents the sign and magnitude ( absolute value ) of the argument . if the sign is negative , the first character of the result is ' - ' ( ' - ' ) ; if the sign is positive , no sign character appears in the result . as for the magnitude : if is infinity , it is represented by the characters " infinity " ; thus , positive infinity produces the result " infinity " and negative infinity produces the result " - infinity " . if is zero , it is represented by the characters " 0 . 0 " ; thus , negative zero produces the result " - 0 . 0 " and positive zero produces the result " 0 . 0 " . if is greater than or equal to 10 - 3 but less than 107 , then it is represented as the integer part of , in decimal form with no leading zeroes , followed by ' . ' ( . ) , followed by one or more decimal digits representing the fractional part of . if is less than 10 - 3 or not less than 107 , then it is represented in so - called " computerized scientific notation .

test5472	this method deals with the fact , that the decoding process doesn ' t always yield a single most likely value . the current error correction implementation doesn ' t deal with erasures very well , so it ' s better to provide a value for these ambiguous codewords instead of treating it as an erasure . the problem is that we don ' t know which of the ambiguous values to choose . we try decode using the first value , and if that fails , we use another of the ambiguous values and try to decode again . this usually only happens on very hard to read and decode barcodes , so decoding the normal barcodes is not affected by this .

test7558	to support deletion we will remove any entries for the provided address . this is just to yank something out of the cache which was created and then immediately deleted on the rw store before it could be written through to the disk . this does not reclaim any space in the write cache since allocations are strictly sequential within the cache and can only be used with the rw store . the rw store uses write prefixes in the cache buffer so we must zero the long address element as well to indicate that the record was removed from the buffer . this approach has now been refined to avoid problems with incremental checksums which otherwise would invalidate the buffer checksum to date . rather than zeroing the address of the deleted block a new zero - length prefix is written that when processed will ensure any current recordmap entry is removed . todo : an issue to be worked through is whether there remains a problem with a full buffer where there is not room for the dummy " remove " prefix . whilst we could of course ensure that a buffer with less than the space required for prefixwrites should be moved immediately to the dirtlylist , there would still exist the possibility that the clear could be requested on a buffer already on the dirtylist . it looks like this should not matter , since each buffer update can be considered as an atomic update even if the set of writes are individually not atomic ( the updates from a previous buffer will always have been completed before the next buffer is processed ) . in that case it appears we could ignore the situation where there is no room for the dummy " remove " prefix , since there will be no room for a new write also and the buffer will be flushed either on commit or a subsequent write . a problem previously existed with unsynchronized access to the bytebuffer . resulting in a conflict over the position ( ) and buffer corruption . if the writecache is closed then it must not be modified at all otherwise any ha replication will not be binary compatible .
